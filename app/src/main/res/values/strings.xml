    <string name="id91">Presenting Author: Elias-Gutierrez Manuel\n\nContact: melias@ecosur.mx\n\nAuthors: Manuel Elias-Gutierrez, Virginia Leon-Regagnon\n\nAbstract: \nBackground \nThe 2M km2 of territory occupied by the Mexican Republic is the 4th most biodiverse country in the world. Regardless of this outstanding natural capital, as the National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) has called it, support for research in this area has been quite limited by the federal agencies such as the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), compared to other countries. \nResults\n In spite of this resourcing challenge, several strategies were developed by Mexican researchers when they realized that DNA barcoding became an important tool to overcome the taxonomic impediment: the Mexican Barcode Network (MEXBOL) was established, including a National Laboratory focused on reducing the costs of DNA analyses; alliances between interested institutions were built; and main biorepositories got involved. The confidence of the academicians allowed this country to rank among the top ten nations in terms of DNA barcoding of the national biota, with results in almost all important groups of animals, fungi, and plants. New species of fish, echinoderms, crustaceans, insects, polychaetes, leeches, platyhelminths, and acanthocephalans highlighted by the barcodes have been described. New insights into the diversity of rotifers, molluscs, and the above-mentioned groups have been discovered, with a much higher diversity than expected. Diverse applications of barcoding, such as analyses of seafood, exotic species, disease vectors, and a database of endangered species to help in the control of trafficking, have been developed. With a group of well-trained taxonomists, we are adopting new strategies, considering next-generation sequencing, and looking to integrative taxonomy in response to new questions. Finally, we started an educational program with a mobile PCR lab in schools. \nSignificance\n In sum, Mexican researchers have developed creativity and efficiency in order to use to maximal effect the limited support provided by national science policies and funders. These advances are particularly important in the face of the urgent need for a better understanding of the amazing and threatened biodiversity in this region of the world.</string>
    <string name="id232">Presenting Author: Beentjes, Kevin\n\nContact: kevin.beentjes@naturalis.nl\n\nAuthors: Kevin Beentjes, Arjen Speksnijder, Berry van der Hoorn, Jan van Tol\n\nAbstract: \nBackground\n The national DNA barcoding project funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs is nearing its final stages. The DNA barcoding project at Naturalis focused on the Dutch flora and fauna. Large projects involving bryophytes and vascular plants succeeded in covering most of the flora of the Netherlands, with a combined total of over 6,000 specimens barcoded. The Dutch fauna mostly involved arthropod groups such as the Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera, with over 10,000 specimens collected by both employees and 200 citizen specialists, which were subsequently barcoded. The Lepidoptera were represented by over 10,000 barcoded specimens as well, spread over several projects, both Dutch and international. The Odonata collections of Naturalis provided over 8,000 sequenced specimens from all over the world. \nResults\n Whilst the original goal was to sequence 27,000 specimens, the current total of sequenced samples has already exceeded 40,000. With several additional projects processed in the high-throughput facility, the Naturalis DNA bank has surpassed 60,000 DNA extracts. All extracts are stored and are available for future research. With the end of the project in sight, the contribution to BOLD by Naturalis is growing. At least 27,000 successful sequences will be uploaded to public databases. Voucher specimens will be accessible through the Naturalis Bioportal (http://bioportal.naturalis.nl). \nSignificance\n The current database is applied in identification requests relating to wildlife forensics projects, bird strikes at civilian and air force airports, food quality and food safety issues, and insurance claims. While there are currently no plans for a continuation of the large-scale DNA barcoding, there will be an additional focus on the barcoding of freshwater organisms of the Water Framework Directive in the coming years, with grants received from the Gieskes-Strijbis fund. In addition, various projects have already been started using the DNA barcoding pipeline to solve different scientific questions within Naturalis.</string>
    <string name="id323">Presenting Author: Ekrem, Torbjorn\n\nContact: torbjorn.ekrem@ntnu.no\n\nAuthors:Torbjorn Ekrem, Inger G. Alsos, Arild Johnsen, Endre Willassen, Aina Maerk Aspaas, Marie K. Foreid, Katrine Kongshavn, Gunnhild Marthinsen\n\nAbstract\nBackground\n NorBOL (www.norbol.org) was formed in 2007 as a national network to 1) advance barcoding of Norwegian and Arctic biodiversity, 2) raise funding, 3) curate barcode reference material, 4) coordinate and initiate new barcoding projects, and 5) increase public awareness of DNA barcoding and barcoding results in Norway. NorBOL is a regional node within iBOL, with a particular responsibility for Polar Regions. NorBOL is coordinated by the NTNU University Museum in Trondheim and connects 16 institutions, including all four major natural history museums as well as all major research institutes in Norway. \nResults\n Despite strong support among research institutions, substantial external funding was only first achieved in 2012 through a grant from the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre. Further funding was obtained in 2014 from both the Research Council of Norway and the Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre. Since then, barcoding progress of the Norwegian fauna, flora, and fungi has increased, and the Barcode of Life Data Systems database currently holds more than 42,000 published sequence records (27,000 DNA barcodes) of more than 7,200 species from Norway. \nSignificance\n The goal for NorBOL is to barcode 20,000 species by the end of 2018. NorBOL currently targets barcoding of museum collections, lichens, fungi, marine invertebrates, fish, and material from biosurveillance projects supported by the Norwegian Taxonomy Initiative. We collaborate with Swedish institutions on sampling of marine invertebrates, earthworms, and insects. An expansion of inter-Scandinavian barcoding collaboration is in progress. As the standard barcode gene regions have limited taxonomic resolution for the species level in many vascular plant groups, we are engaged in testing if low-coverage shotgun sequencing of herbarium material is useful to obtain the full plant plastid genomes.</string>
    <string name="id473">Presenting Author: Praz, Christophe\n\nContact: christophe.praz@unine.ch\n\nAuthors: Christophe Praz\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n DNA barcoding is used both for specimen identification and as a tool for species delimitation. Molecular identification is problematic when distinct species share identical sequences, for example following mitochondrial introgression. Species delimitation is complicated by deep within-species divergences that erode the barcoding gap. Here I use the western Palaearctic bees of the large genus Megachile to examine the performance of the mitochondrial barcode in molecular identification and species delimitation. \nResults\n Over 400 DNA barcodes were generated for 70 of the approximately 100 described species in the western Palaearctic. No evidence of mitochondrial introgression was revealed, even among closely related species found in sympatry and infected with identical strains of Wolbachia, suggesting that this phenomenon does not pose a major problem in this group of bees. However, in the majority of species examined across their entire range, multiple, strongly divergent mitochondrial haplotypes exist within single species. In most cases different haplotypes are found in different geographic regions, but in a few cases widely different haplotypes are found in sympatry. In all cases, the use of nuclear markers is necessary to determine species boundaries. The fast-evolving marker ITS2 is particularly useful for species delimitation, although it exhibited intragenomic diversity in most species examined. Yet once clean sequences are obtained through cloning, the multiple copies may highlight recent gene flow. \nSignificance\n Identification using mitochondrial barcodes is not affected by these common deep within-species divergences, provided that an accurate library is available across the entire range of the species. However, these deep divergences greatly limit the use of the mitochondrial barcode for species delimitation. These results confirm that mitochondrial barcodes should not be used alone to delimit species; even when nuclear markers are used, I recommend detailed studies of the contact zone between genetically divergent populations to determine species boundaries.</string>
    <string name="id446">Presenting Author: Sonet, Gontran\n\nContact:gsonet@naturalsciences.be\n\nAuthors: Gontran Sonet, Alain Pauly, Nathalie Smitz, Massimiliano Virgilio, Zoltan T Nagy, Kurt Jordaens, Sebastien Molle, Thierry Backeljau, Marc De Meyer\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nHigh-throughput sequencing of PCR amplicons, also called targeted amplicon sequencing (TAS), combines the flexibility of PCR amplification with next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. In comparison with Sanger sequencing, NGS potentially improves the sequencing success rate and the detection of heteroplasmy, heterozygosity in nuclear markers, and endosymbionts. Here, we applied TAS to simultaneously sequence the COI barcode region, three nuclear markers (wingless, white gene, and HOG7036-02), and a fragment of the Wolbachia surface protein (wsp) in 24 museum bee specimens of Halictus (Seladonia). This bee genus is frequently infected by Wolbachia, and one of the species, Halictus smaragdulus Vachal, 1895, is suspected to be a species complex on the basis of the morphological variation in the male genitalia. Results obtained for the DNA barcode fragment were compared to those obtained by Sanger sequencing, using the same specimens and DNA extracts. \nResults\nSequencing of COI was more successful with NGS (21/24 specimens) than with Sanger sequencing (18/24 specimens). COI haplotypes obtained from both approaches were identical and showed divergences that were congruent with the male genitalia differentiation. These results suggest that H. smaragdulus comprises more than one species. No signs of heteroplasmy were observed. Nuclear markers were successfully sequenced for 15-20 (62-83 percent) of the specimens, and Wolbachia was detected in ca. 50 percent of the individuals. \nSignificance\nBy sequencing standard DNA barcodes and specific DNA markers (including DNA fragments from Wolbachia), we produced a dataset that allows a better taxonomic interpretation of the species complex.</string>
    <string name="id70">Presenting Author: Rowe, Genevieve\n\nContact:genevieve.rowe@ymail.com\n\nAuthors: Genevieve Rowe, Terry Griswold, Laurence Packer\n\nAbstract\nBackground\n Osmiine bees are important both economically as manageable bees and ecologically as major pollinators. They remain poorly understood taxonomically. One aspect is the frequent division of species into subspecies—a taxonomic level with an ambiguous meaning. Here, the status of these entities is critically evaluated. \nResults\nConcurrent with previous and recent morphological assessments, high levels of intraspecific divergence within several species suggest the presence of species complexes within three genera of the Osmiini—Atoposmia, Ashmeadiella, and Hoplitis. Deep divergences in the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and morphological assessments support the separation of several polytypic species among these genera, in some cases elevating subspecies to species status. \nSignificance\nOne new species is described, and changes in classification among the three genera are suggested.</string>
    <string name="id381">Presenting Author: Gibbs, Jason\n\nContact: jgibbs@msu.edu\n\nAuthors: Jason Gibbs\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nLasioglossum (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) is the most species-rich, behaviourally complex, and taxonomically challenging genus of bees. Species from across North America have been sequenced as a component of multiple taxonomic monographs. \nResults\nDNA barcoding results support numerous cryptic species in the genus Lasioglossum. In many cases DNA barcodes correspond well with morphological and geographic data. In other cases, conflicts between DNA barcodes and other data are not easily resolved. Shared haplotypes between and deep divergences within putative species can be misleading if examined uncritically. Published data show that standard universal barcode primers are a poor choice for Lasioglossum and lead to relatively frequent amplification of the endosymbiont Wolbachia (Rickettsiales). \nSignificance\nDNA barcodes provide a useful tool for challenging taxonomic groups, but data must be interpreted with care. Future efforts to barcode bees should use bee-specific primers to increase successful amplification of barcode sequences.</string>
    <string name="id71">Presenting Author: Gonzalez–Vaquero, Rocio Ana\n\nContact: rocioagv@yahoo.com\n\nAuthors:Rocio Ana Gonzalez–Vaquero, Arturo Roig Alsina, Laurence Packer\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe bee genera Corynura and Halictillus (Hymenoptera: Halictidae) contain species that are very abundant in Chile and Argentinean Patagonia, and which are key elements in southern South-American ecosystems. For instance, C. chloris is among the major pollinators of crops such as raspberry, Chilean hazel, and buckwheat as well as native wildflowers. These bee species are very difficult to identify due to close morphological similarity among species and extreme sexual dimorphism. To assess this, we analyzed the barcodes of 15 species of Corynura, as part of a revision of the genus, as well as four species of Halictillus. \nResults\nWe obtained 170 barcode-compliant sequences. Barcodes were useful to confirm gender associations and to detect two cryptic species previously considered as one. The genera showed a median interspecific distance (13.5-14.3 percent), considerably higher than among other closely related halictid genera. The sequence divergence between specimens of the same species was up to 0.9 percent, with a few exceptions. The barcodes of five specimens differed from the rest by more than 2 percent, although these individuals were not morphologically different from the others, nor collected in distant areas. In contrast, C. patagonica showed a distance of 4.2 percent when any of the specimens from Chile was compared to those from Argentina. The only morphological difference found between the barcode clusters was the colour of the metasomal terga of the female. BIN analysis was useful to identify the species that showed high intraspecific variation. \nSignificance\nSpecies delimitation and identification is particularly important in halictine bees, which are renowned for being morphologically monotonous. The results suggest that Corynura and Halictillus species can be identified through DNA barcodes, although some species showed a high intraspecific variation which requires further study. We conclude that C. patagonica is probably two cryptic species.</string>
    <string name="id294">Presenting Author: Barajas, Ricardo Ayala\n\nContact: rayala@ib.unam.mx\n\nAuthors: Ricardo Ayala, Laurence Packer\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBees are considered some of the more important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants; these provide essential ecosystem service that result in the out-crossing and sexual reproduction of many plants. The rich bee fauna of Mexico encompasses 6 families and 153 genera, with approximately 1839 currently recognized species. The distribution of the richness between families is as follows: Apidae 606 species, Andrenidae 535, Megachilidae 355, Halictidae 229, Colletidae 103, and Melittidae 11. Due to gaps in faunistic studies, the bee fauna of Mexico is certainly much richer, perhaps well in excess of 2000 species. The diversity of bees in Mexico appears intermediate between that of the United States and countries of Central America. Despite their ecological and economic importance, bees are facing threats from growing loss of habitats principally in tropical areas. Thus, it is urgent to conduct more taxonomic studies including the DNA Barcode of Life project, which could help taxonomic studies by providing a practical method for the identification of species for others with interest in bees, or studies in environmental science, conservation, or pollination. We began our participation in the iBOL project in 2008, as part of BEEBOL, which was promoted by Dr. Laurence Packer. At this point there are about 3000 Mexican bee specimens in BOLD with about 1000 species. There are representatives of taxa with ecological importance such as Centridini and Euglossini, as well as genera that are important as pollinators for agriculture, such as Bombus, Osmia, Xylocopini, and many Eucerini; as well as groups that are important in meliponiculture (Meliponini). The following stage is the accomplishment of new faunistic projects, to organize more specimens of Mexican bees to be sequenced, in a strategy that includes species of economic or biological importance. Also accomplished is the completion of taxonomic revisions of some taxa of bees with the aid of the DNA Barcode of Life, in addition to morphological information.</string>
    <string name="id261">Presenting Author: Bukowski Belén \n\nContact: belenbukowski@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Belén Bukowski, Priscila E. Hanisch, Pablo L. Tubaro, Darío A. Lijtmaer\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEnvironmental disturbance and global climate change are modifying the species composition of terrestrial communities before we get to know them. Notably, most species in terrestrial ecosystems are arthropods, and therefore reliable tools for their collection and identification are necessary. DNA barcoding can provide this. In this context, the Global Malaise Program has been established a few years ago, and Argentina is actively participating with traps placed in four different locations throughout the country. In particular, the first Malaise trap was deployed in Misiones province in the southern extreme of the Atlantic Forest, generating the first results in South America. \nResults\nInsects were collected every week for two years. In total, 34,103 specimens were obtained from the first 22 bottles sampled throughout the first year, which constitutes the highest number of specimens collected by a Malaise trap in the global project so far. A total of 30,771 barcode sequences were obtained, and most of them received a BIN assignment. The order Diptera dominated in specimen abundance (77 percent), followed by Hemiptera (8 percent), and Lepidoptera (5 percent). For these 22 samples, 5,646 unique BINs were generated, and 92 percent of them were new to BOLD. The species accumulation curve suggests that a large proportion of species have yet to be sampled, and the Chao’s estimate of species richness suggests that almost twice as many BINs could be found by Malaise trapping in this location. \nSignificance\nThe results of this first trap allowed us to add many new species into the growing library of DNA barcodes. It also contributed to the knowledge of the insects of southern South America. The strikingly high number of insects (and BINS/species) collected by this single trap clearly indicates that even though northeastern Argentina harbors the southern extreme of the Atlantic Forest, its biodiversity is remarkable.</string>
    <string name="id39">Presenting Author: Kohn, Joshua\n\nContact: jkohn@ucsd.edu\n\nAuthors: Joshua Kohn, David O\'Connor, James Danoff-Burg, Heather Henter, Bradley Zlotnick\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe California Floristic Province is recognized as a global hotspot of endangered biodiversity owing to the high levels of diversity and endemism present in various taxonomic groups (e.g. plants, vertebrates) and the high level of threat from anthropogenic sources. Unfortunately, regional data on insect diversity that can be readily compared with other regions is lacking. \nResults\nWe used a 60 km transect of six Malaise traps along the San Dieguito River Valley of western San Diego County (California, USA) to begin a comprehensive survey of insect diversity using DNA barcoding. Sequencing of 21,118 specimens revealed 2,654 BINs (MOTUs) of which 1,207 (45.5 percent) were singletons. The large number of rare taxa precludes reliable estimation of total species richness, but comparisons to studies of similar sampling intensity suggest that the discovery rate of BINs in this region is not unusually high. This is surprising both because of the region’s high diversity in other taxonomic groups and also the substantial spatial β-diversity evident in our data from different traps. High β-diversity should raise the discovery rate in comparison to studies where β-diversity is low or only a single trap location was used to sample a similar number of specimens. \nSignificance\nEither the insect fauna of Southern California is not unusually diverse or total diversity is so high, both here and elsewhere, that current levels of Malaise trap sampling make broad-scale comparisons premature.</string>
    <string name="id61">Presenting Author: D\'Souza, Michelle\n\nContact: mdsouza@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Michelle D\'Souza\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nCurrent understanding of terrestrial arthropod biodiversity within the tropics is inadequate due to the inability to comprehensively sample and identify specimens in these hyperdiverse ecosystems. DNA barcoding is an excellent tool to overcome this barrier. I analysed terrestrial arthropod biodiversity patterns at two sites in Parque Nacional Cusuco, Honduras, by employing Malaise traps as a standardized sampling technique and the Barcode Index Number (BIN) as a proxy for species. BIN counts and phylogenetic community structure were subsequently examined to determine diversity within and between sites. \nResults\nMalaise traps were deployed in two broadleaf forest sites roughly two km apart with a 300 m elevational difference. A total of 1,103 and 1,804 BINs were collected at the two sites over a 14-week period. Insecta dominated the arthropod communities at both sites, comprising 95 percent of the BINs versus Arachnida (3 percent) and Collembola (2 percent). The collection largely contained members of five insect orders: Diptera (52 percent), Hymenoptera (17 percent), Coleoptera (11 percent), Lepidoptera (6 percent), and Hemiptera (4 percent). Despite the small distance between the two sites and the analysis of more than 11,000 specimens, they shared only 9 percent of their BINs. The low overlap was a consequence, at least in part, of incomplete sampling as revealed by the BIN accumulation curves and the high proportion of singletons (62 percent). Various arthropod groups between the sites displayed more phylogenetic dissimilarity than expected based on a null model, demonstrating that variation between sites can be detected despite incomplete community sampling. \nSignificance\nThe examination of tropical biodiversity patterns, despite the many challenges of comprehensive sampling, can benefit from a phylogenetic perspective aided by null models and DNA barcodes. As investigations into the phylogenetic community structure of tropical arthropods are lacking, such studies can help determine if species turnover is phylogenetically non-random and can provide valuable insights into the various mechanistic theories of community assembly.</string>
    <string name="id406">Presenting Author: Hanisch, Priscila E.\n\nContact: phanisch@macn.gov.ar\n\nAuthors: Priscila E. Hanisch, Pablo D. Lavinia, Pablo L. Tubaro, Andrew V. Suarez, Carolina I. Paris\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nAnts are a key component of terrestrial ecosystems because they provide several ecological services such as seed dispersal, organic matter decomposition, and soil nutrient cycling. Here, we assess, through the generation and analysis of DNA barcodes, the diversity of ants of Iguazú National Park (INP) as part of a major project that aims to barcode the ants of Argentina. The INP constitutes a biodiversity hotspot located in northeastern Argentina with over 200 species of ants and represents one of the biggest remnants of the Atlantic Forest, which is a priority for conservation as it harbors 7 percent of world’s diversity. \nResults\nWe obtained 178 COI sequences from 332 individuals belonging to more than 100 species from over 30 genera. Unidentified species were not included. The mean intraspecific sequence divergence was slightly over 0.70 percent, which was 23 times lower than the mean interspecific divergence (16.6 percent). After removing a few species with strikingly deep intraspecific divergence, the mean intraspecific divergence fell to 0.30 percent. There were more BINs (73) than species (67), with no BIN being shared by different species. Seven species showed two clearly differentiated barcode clusters, suggesting the possible presence of cryptic biodiversity at INP. The existence of these divergent intraspecific lineages was supported by high node support values in complementary phylogenetic analyses. \nSignificance\nTaxonomic keys for Neotropical ants are mostly incomplete and based almost exclusively on workers, precluding the identification of males and queens of most species. Increasing the reference barcode library for the ants of INP (and Argentina) will certainly help to identify these castes and to register morphological variability of Neotropical ants, which may eventually lead to the generation of new taxonomic keys. Lastly, our results support the biodiversity hotspot status of the Atlantic Forest and suggest that ant diversity in INP is currently being underestimated.</string>
    <string name="id404">Presenting Author: Pare, Kate\n\nContact: kpare@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Kate Pare, M. Alex Smith\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nTaxonomic impediments can exist due to the presence of cryptic lineages residing within named species and the lack of taxonomic expertise available to recognise and formally assign names to these species. Such overlooked diversity provides a challenge when studying biogeographical patterns in hyper-diverse groups or in diversity hotspots such as the Neotropics. Using DNA barcodes as a proxy for species names can remove the confounding factor of cryptic and unnamed diversity and allow that diversity to be compared between multiple locations. \nResults\nUsing DNA barcodes and rDNA sequences as proxies for species-level identifications, we tested the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and elevation as well as between phylogenetic community structure and elevation. We predicted that Collembola diversity would increase with elevation due to the increase in moisture. Furthermore, we expected phylogenetic structure to be more clustered at low elevations compared to high elevations, due to dry environmental conditions selecting for specific lineages of Collembola able to survive such challenging conditions. \nSignificance\nCollembola are small, abundant leaf-litter hexapods, which are important prey items for arthropods and vertebrates and aid in the decomposition of organic matter. Collembola are also sensitive to desiccation, making them ideal organisms to study how diversity changes along environmental gradients. However, because of their small size and cryptic biology, there are challenges associated with accurately estimating diversity within this group, necessitating the use of techniques that analyse molecular estimates of diversity and phylogenetic structure.</string>

Janzen\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nThe diversity and phylogenetic community structure of many organisms is negatively affected by factors that covary with elevation. Many Neotropical species whose range is restricted to tropical montane cloud forests are in danger of local or total extinction due to warming and drying as air warmed by climate change ascends these mountains. On the Pacific slope of the Cordillera Guanacaste within Area de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica, we used standardised collections and DNA barcodes to quantify community size and diversity for some of the most abundant leaf-litter fauna (ants, spiders, springtails, and isopods). \nResults\nThe relationship between elevation and diversity on each of three ACG volcanos is specific to the taxa in question. For example, ants and spiders displayed a strong mid-elevation diversity peak that was evident when diversity was measured through molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTU) or by phylogenetic diversity (PD) based on DNA barcodes or a multi-gene phylogeny. For ants and spiders from the highest elevation cloud forest sites, we found evidence of significant phylogenetic clustering, the expected result of filtering due to harsh environmental conditions. Species turnover between sites on the same mountain and among the three mountains was high. \nSignificance\nThe narrow elevation range of each species, coupled with the high diversity at each sampling point, emphasizes that climate change will bring strong alterations in the location and composition of biodiversity on these mountains. The structure and composition of the hyperdiverse communities present at any one elevation is extremely vulnerable to a changing climate.</string>

Previous field studies of faunivorous primates have been limited by an inability to accurately determine which animal prey are consumed, decreasing the researchers’ abilities to assess the influence of variation in animal prey availability, age- and sex-based differences in prey choice, and how prey choice relates to foraging microhabitats. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of invertebrate mtDNA from the feces of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) to determine patterns of animal prey consumption over a yearlong study. From January 2013 - January 2014, behavioural data was collected from a group of 22 white-faced capuchins at La Suerte Biological Field Station, Costa Rica. Invertebrate availability was monitored using canopy traps and sweep netting. Fecal samples were collected from adult female, adult male, and juvenile white-faced capuchins (n=235). A fragment (~300bp) of the COI mtDNA was amplified using universal invertebrate primers. Samples were individually barcoded and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units, which were compared to known COI sequences in GenBank and the Barcode of Life Data Systems. \nResults\nTwenty new orders of arthropods were identified in the white-faced capuchin diet during the study period. Fluctuations in invertebrate availability influenced observed foraging behavior, but did not influence the frequency of consumption of specific orders of invertebrates. We observed few differences in invertebrate foraging behavior and diet of male and female individuals; however, we found significant differences between adult and juvenile foraging strategies and dietary choices. \nSignificance\nThis study greatly increases our knowledge of the diversity of invertebrates in white-faced capuchin diets and gives us a more in-depth understanding of both the influence of food availability and sex- and age-based differences on prey foraging strategies in primates.</string>
    <string name="id288">Presenting Author: Kartzinel, Tyler\n\nContact: tylerk@princeton.edu\n\nAuthors: Tyler Kartzinel, Robert Pringle\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEcological theory dictates that large mammalian herbivores (LMH) must partition food resources to coexist. Traditional frameworks categorize LMH along a spectrum of dietary niches from grass-eating grazers to non-grass-eating browsers, yet it has never been clear how finely LMH partition the enormous plant diversity represented by these two broad plant types. \nResults\nWe are using a DNA metabarcoding approach in conjunction with a local plant DNA barcode library to compare the diets of a diverse assemblage of LMH species (17 wild; 5 domestic) at Mpala Research Centre, Kenya. Using independent carbon stable isotope measurements to evaluate the reliability of DNA metabarcoding for quantifying dietary grass:browse ratios, we show that the diets of these species are shown to span a continuum from almost-pure grazers to almost-pure browsers. Moreover, the composition of plant species within diets was similar within LMH species and clearly divergent across species, irrespective of their traditionally recognized feeding guild. \nSignificance\nThese results suggest that species-specific plant traits may be key to understanding the dietary differences thought to shape the origin and maintenance of LMH diversity. This hypothesis motivates ongoing experimental research into the determinants of LMH dietary variation, as well as the practical ways that rangelands can be managed to avoid diet-mediated conflicts between livestock and wildlife.</string>
    <string name="id510">Presenting Author: Mitchell, Andrew\n\nContact: andrew.mitchell@austmus.gov.au\n\nAuthors: Andrew Mitchell, Yohannes Alemseged\n\nAbstract\nAbout three-quarters of Australia’s area is rangeland. It contains a wealth of biodiversity including more than 1800 plant and 600 vertebrate species. This land must be managed for a complex mix of interests, including agricultural production and conservation. The recent introduction of a more drought-tolerant breed of sheep, the Dorper, to western New South Wales (NSW) has raised environmental concerns because of potential impacts on rangeland conditions. As part of a larger project investigating best management practices for Dorpers on NSW rangelands, we compared the diets of Dorpers, Merinos, and goats using a DNA metabarcoding approach. \nWe first produced a reference DNA barcode library for rbcL, matK, and ITS2 sequences for the 20 most common species thought to comprise the bulk of sheep diets in western NSW. Then we PCR amplified a 250 bp fragment of rbcL and complete ITS2 (~260 bp) sequences from 24 dung samples, indexed them using a Nextera kit and sequenced them in a single run on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We obtained 1.1 million sequences, or a mean of 46,000 sequences per sample. After quality controls, we had around 20-100 unique haplotypes per sample. In total 90 ‘species’ were identified from all faecal samples but less than half of the reference library sequences were recovered from dung samples. \nMany sequences could not be exactly matched to one plant species because of either insufficient resolving power (i.e. multiple species with exact matches in BOLD, most rbcL sequences) or no exact match either in BOLD or in the small reference library we generated (most ITS2 sequences). Family-level identification was possible for all sequences recovered from all samples. At the family level Dorper dung contained 7 plant families not found in Merino dung, and no families were unique to Merino dung, confirming that Dorpers have broader diets than merinos.</string>
    <string name="id422">Presenting Author: Jean-Luc Jung\n\nContact: jung@univ-brest.fr\n\nAuthors: Jean-Luc Jung\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nMarine mammals are long-lived top predators relying on lower trophic levels. As such, they act as sentinel species of the health of marine and coastal ecosystems, especially when impacts of anthropogenic origin are suspected. However, monitoring the presence and diversity of these mobile and elusive marine mammals is challenging. For some years, we have applied DNA barcoding to the study of marine mammal samples collected by stranding networks in different areas presenting diverse levels of biodiversity and fieldwork conditions. \nResults\nAlong the French Atlantic Coast, a National Stranding Network has been taking samples since the end of the 70\'s. We sequenced the 5’end of the COI gene of 15 different species (12 cetaceans and three pinnipeds). We confirmed that field taxonomic identifications were of a great accuracy and that undetermined samples can be, as expected, identified using DNA barcodes. Along the Mauritanian coast, surveys are organized in the frame of the program \'Biodiversité, Gaz, Pétrole\' spearheaded by the Mauritanian Government. We analysed more than 100 samples, taken from carcasses of stranded animals. Some highly degraded carcasses led to technical issues, but nevertheless we identified baleen and toothed whales, including rare and unexpected species. We will also present results focusing on two particular species, the harbour porpoise and the grey seal, in terms of (i) phylogenetics and (ii) diet analysis, by barcoding soft remains taken from the stomachs of predators. \nSignificance\nThe relevance and accuracy of the monitoring of marine mammal strandings are strengthened by DNA barcoding at different levels: by confirming the taxonomic identification, by identifying degraded carcasses, by determining intraspecific variations, as well as for diet analysis. This is particularly applicable to remote areas where the rich marine mammal fauna is poorly known and where anthropogenic impacts are highly suspected, such as the Mauritanian coasts.</string>

Gerardo Herrera Montalvo, Virginia León-Regagnon, Aitor Arrizabalaga-Escudero, Elizabeth L. Clare\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSpecies’ interactions are integral to understanding ecological processes such as competition and niche partitioning. However, observing and describing these relationships is challenging, particularly among generalist insectivores. Traditionally, morphological classification of digested prey has been used to limited effect. DNA barcoding provides a powerful solution to characterize these relationships, providing species-level identifications even from degraded material. When coupled with next-generation sequencing, these techniques allow us to unravel the complexity of interactions between predators and prey even in the most complex systems. \nResults\nWe applied DNA metabarcoding to study three species of Pteronotus from a cave in Don Panchito Island in Chamela, Jalisco, México. This area is characterized by seasonal tropical dry forest. We investigate seasonal effects and the degree of overlap and breadth of diet among bats that share roost and foraging area. Lepidoptera and dipterans were the most consumed insect orders, and there was a moderate level of dietary overlap between wet and dry seasons. The highest degree of overlap was between P. parnellii and P. personatus during the wet season. We found more overlap in insects consumed between species in the same seasons than within any single species across seasons. P. davyi and P. personatus increase their dietary breadth during the dry season, and the diet of P. parnellii was broader and had the highest effective number of species in all cases. \nSignificance\nOur results suggest that the diet of these sympatric species is driven more by prey availability than predator characteristic tracking seasonal resources that vary throughout the year. This study provides one of the first detailed views of tropical insectivores and their relationship with resources.</string>

Clare, Antton Alberdi, Egoitz Salsamendi, Joxerra Aihartza, Urtzi Goiti, Inazio Garin\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAccording to the competitive exclusion principle, species coexisting in the same community must differ in the way they use spatial or food resources. When ecologically similar species co-habit, resource partitioning is expected to occur, a mechanism thought to enable the long-term coexistence of species. The study of such a mechanism could be especially important when investigating the foraging requirements of endangered species. However, research on food requirements of endangered species has been limited by the low taxonomic resolution of the employed methodologies. DNA metabarcoding offers a solution to these limitations, allowing species-level identification of consumed prey. In this study, we analyse the dietary niche overlap between the sympatric sibling bat species Rhinolophus euryale and Rhinolophus mehelyi. Previous studies suggested that segregation of foraging habitats is the main mechanism allowing the coexistence of both species, but prey identification was limited to ordinal level. We aimed to elucidate subtle but functionally relevant differences between the consumed prey of these two bat species. \nResults\nUsing DNA metabarcoding we identified 94 MOTUs from the guano of both species, from which we were able to identify 65 percent in BOLD. Analysis of niche breadth and overlap showed that the diet of both bats overlaps to a high extent. Further analysis of the relationship between bats\' diet and their prey size and prey habitat preferences revealed a weak association, which we would expect, given each species\' echo-morphology and foraging habitats. \nSignificance\nOur results showed that both species ate virtually the same prey, suggesting that, in line with previous studies for the same bat individuals, the spatial segregation of the foraging grounds is the main mechanism allowing coexistence between these sibling bats. Therefore, DNA metabarcoding enabled us to gain a deeper understanding of trophic interactions between bats and their insect prey.</string>

It is bordered by Yucatán to the northwest, Campeche to the west, to the south by Belize, and to the north and east by the Caribbean Sea. The state has a privileged geographic position because of its shoreline, which contains a major part of the second-largest barrier reef in the world, the Mesoamerican Reef. Also, four Marine National Parks and two Biosphere Reserves (Banco Chinchorro and Sian Ka´an) are located there. \nResults\nFish barcoding studies in this region began in 2005. After 10 years, 21 projects have been added to BOLD and about 3369 specimens sequenced, 3094 of them marine and 275 freshwater, including adults, juveniles, larvae, and eggs. They represent 116 families, 261 genera, and 397 species of marine fish; 3 families, 4 genera, and 5 species of sharks; 6 families, 6 genera, and 5 species of rays; and 20 genera comprising 27 species of freshwater fish. These results represent about 17 percent of the Mexican ichthyofauna. As for territorial coverage, almost 95 percent of the state has not been studied yet with this technique. \nSignificance\nIn the near future, we will continue to build the database of barcodes especially for freshwater fishes, and we also plan to develop new projects based on topics such as structural diversity, stomach contents, food chains, detection of exotic species, ecosystem health, all of them including information already generated, as well as the use of new methodologies such as metagenomics and eDNA.</string>

While some emblematic islands of the Indonesian archipelago have garnered considerable attention in the past due to the occurrence of charismatic species (e.g. Borneo, Sumatra, Sulawesi), the Javanese and Balinese biodiversity has been poorly explored so far, and freshwater fishes are no exception to this. Java Island, with a human population that has grown to more than 180,000,000 people sharing 128,297 km2, is the most densely populated island of the Indonesian archipelago, and its biodiversity is currently the most endangered of the country. The present survey conducted between 2012 and 2014 aims to re-assess the Javanese and Balinese ichthyodiversity based on systematic and standardized molecular screening. \nResults\nFishes were mainly collected using electrofishing, cast nets, and seine nets between November 2012 and December 2014 at nearly 70 sites distributed across rivers, lakes, ponds, estuaries, and fish markets. More than 1000 specimens belonging to more than 160 nominal species have been sequenced and, together with collection data, submitted to BOLD. Based on DNA barcode data, the number of mitochondrial lineages diverging by more than 2 percent is higher than the number of nominal species, highlighting cryptic or undescribed diversity. In addition, three new species of amphidromous gobies (e.g. Sicyopus, Lentipes, Stiphodon) are described and each is characterized by private mitochondrial lineages. \nSignificance\nThe present study provides the first DNA barcode reference library for the Javanese and Balinese ichthyofauna and also represents the first large-scale DNA barcoding survey in Indonesia. Given the accuracy of the identification based on DNA barcodes, this preliminary library is expected to benefit a large community of users from academic to managing authorities in Indonesia.</string>

Naaum, Rena Shimizu, Neil Sharma, Robert Hanner\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding is being used to catalogue biodiversity and has been shown to be a useful and highly versatile tool for species identification. For example, DNA barcoding has been used to document significant levels of market fraud occurring in the seafood industry. However, this method is currently limited to use only in well-equipped laboratories. The Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) is an excellent source of sequences for developing qPCR assays, which may be more suitable in cases where rapid, portable testing is necessary, or where testing of mixtures is required. \nResults\nExpanding the use of BOLD beyond DNA barcoding, qPCR assays based on DNA barcode sequences have been developed and applied for species identification in seafood applications including identification of blue crab, salmon, and red snapper. Assays can be run on portable, simple instruments to augment current authenticity testing by providing on-site testing. \nSignificance\nRapid, accurate, point-of-need testing for the seafood industry is a key concern for authenticity and traceability of products. However, the limitations of current DNA testing is a barrier to more wide-spread uptake in the industry. Commercial availability real-time PCR assays on portable instruments will allow businesses to implement more in-depth authenticity testing for key products on-site, and provide a means to integrate DNA testing into current quality management practices.</string>

Raupach, Filipe O. Costa\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nOver the last few years, several comprehensive reference libraries of DNA barcodes for marine fishes of Europe have been published with regional focus, but a global appraisal of the progress of the compilation of a reference library for European marine ichthyofauna is still missing. Here we assemble for the first time a large-scale comprehensive reference library for this ichthyofauna, based on all publicly available DNA barcodes, with the aim to examine and annotate consistency and reliability of records obtained independently from multiple regions and studies. \nResults\nWe assembled a large dataset comprising 4118 DNA barcodes from fish specimens collected in Europe, representing 358 species, mined from 18 projects on BOLD and a total of 13 research papers. A BIN (Barcode Index Number) Discordance Report was generated for the BOLD dataset, showing 366 BINS (13 species were not available on BOLD) of which 213 were concordant (1 BIN= 1 species), 141 discordant, and 12 singletons. Subsequent inspection of the BIN composition revealed potential artifacts (i.e. synonyms, misidentifications, BIN’s incapability to resolve cluster boundaries) resulting in 73 percent concordant species IDs, 5 percent with comparatively high intraspecific divergence (e.g. European seabass), and 8 percent of poorly represented species. Many economically important species such as mackerel, salmonids, and various sharks are included in the 14 percent of ambiguous species IDs. \nSignificance\nAbout 3/4 of the European marine fishes species examined displayed DNA barcodes of high taxonomic congruency, a proximate proportion to what has been reported in sub-regional scope studies. The compilation of this European-scale library unraveled pertinent cases of high within-species divergence and taxonomic uncertainties that should be further investigated. Despite the usefulness of this core reference library, which includes most of the economically relevant species, the majority of the European marine fish species is still missing. Therefore, efforts to complete this library should continue.</string>

Novel palaeogenetic tools can be used to identify ancient fish remains, allowing researchers to better understand our all but forgotten relationship with the sea. DNA was extracted from the remains of small fishes and large marine predators excavated from late iron age and ancient roman settlements in coastal Iberia (4th-2nd century BCE; n=23), Byzantine-era Constantinople (4th-15th century CE; n=6), and a 20th century collection of vertebrae from the Ionian, Tyrrhenian, and Adriatic Seas (n=208). Mini-barcodes were amplified using newly developed primers targeting diagnostic genes (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, mitochondrial control region, and internal transcribed spacer 1). \nResults\nSamples were identified to genus level with a 78 percent success rate, while 70 percent of samples were identified to species. BLAST, neighbour joining trees, and a character-based identification key were used to analyze DNA sequences, and the latter was most effective due to the short length of DNA amplified (80-180bp). Among the species identified were Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus), chub mackerel (Scomber colias), bonito (Sarda sarda), mackerel (Scomber scombrus), bullet tuna (Auxis rochei), and swordfish (Xiphias gladius). \nSignificance\nThe techniques developed during this study have potential for future use in both ancient and modern (traceability of cooked or canned food products) forensic investigations. Used for archeological purposes, our methods can help to identify damaged and incomplete animal remains and provide information about historical human diets, trade, species distribution and biodiversity.</string>

Special emphasis will be on the Mediterranean Biodiversity Hotspot as one of the most important temperate biodiversity areas, with a remarkable diversity of freshwater fishes. Currently, 397 out of 526 species are recognized as endemic. In order to assess their diversity, and to construct a molecular identification system that supports conservation, we have built a DNA barcode library for 498 Mediterranean freshwater fish species (98 percent extant species coverage) based on 3171 individuals. \nResults\nCongruence of clusters with morphological species ranged from 45 – 85 percent of the species and was highly dependent on the method used to delineate clusters. Genetic discontinuities suggest the existence of up to 64 possible new species or new records, potentially increasing fish diversity by 12 percent. Shared haplotypes among species highlight limits of a barcoding approach, although mismatches tend to occur in recently diverged (Pleistocene- or Holocene-evolved) lineages. We found reduced reliability of DNA barcoding in a highly biogeographically structured area, but much greater accuracy when applied at the catchment scale. This scale effect can have important implications for barcoding assessments, and our results suggest that fairly simple identification pipelines can be successfully applied for local freshwater fish monitoring. Inventorying and management of large-scale diversity requires higher analytical and conceptual efforts. \nSignificance\nThe 98 percent extant species coverage of freshwater fish species of the Mediterranean Biodiversity for barcode sequences represents a success story for biodiversity research in a geopolitically complex region. The database will enable the recognition of conservation units within the Hotspot and will strongly support the ongoing exploration of global freshwater fish diversity.</string>

I will also summarise some of uses made of our reference libraries in Australia (for example, in identifying shark fins, in helping to describe foodwebs, in uncovering cryptic species, and in identifying market products) and some of the lessons learnt (for example, in the difficulties of making correct initial identifications).</string>
    <string name="id119">Presenting Author: Raupach, Michael\n\nContact: mraupach@senckenberg.de\n\nAuthors: Michael Raupach, Andrea Barco, Jan Beermann, Alexander Kieneke, Silke Laakmann, Inga Mohrbeck, Hermann Neumann, Thomas Knebelsberger\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n During the last years, the effectiveness of DNA barcoding for animal species identification has been proven in many studies, analyzing both vertebrate and invertebrate taxa. In terms of marine organisms, however, most barcoding studies typically focus on economically relevant species, for example fish, as well as on the documentation of hotspots of species diversity, for example tropical coral reefs or regions of the almost unexplored deep sea regions. In contrast to this, species diversity of “well-known” habitats is nearly neglected. As part of our running project we started to build up a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the metazoan taxa of the North Sea, one of the most extensively studied ecosystems of the world. The North Sea is characterized by a high amount of anthropogenic pressure such as intensive fishing and ship traffic as well as offshore installations. Environmental parameters (e.g. depth, sediment characteristics, temperature, and salinity) of this semi-enclosed shelf sea follow a distinct pattern: high seasonal fluctuations can be observed in southern areas, but low fluctuations are given in the northern regions. This heterogeneity is also displayed in macrobenthic community structures, with a lower number of species in the shallow southern parts (i.e. the German Bight) and more species in the central and northern North Sea. In addition to this, species with a typical Mediterranean-Lusitanean distribution are also known to occur in parts of the North Sea where oceanic influences prevail. \nResults\n Our barcode library includes a broad variety of taxa, including typical taxa of marine barcoding studies, for example fish or decapod crustaceans. Our on-growing library also includes groups that are often ignored as cnidarians, parasitic crustaceans, echinoderms, mollusks, pantopods, polychaets, and others. In total, our library includes more than 4,200 DNA barcodes of more than 600 species at the moment. By using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), unique BINs were identified for more than 90 percent of the analyzed species. \nSignificance\n Our data represent a first step towards the establishment of a comprehensive DNA barcode library of the Metazoa of the North Sea. Despite the fact that various taxa are still missing or are currently underrepresented, our results clearly underline the usefulness of DNA barcodes to discriminate the vast majority of the analyzed species. It should be also kept in mind that the benefits of DNA barcoding are not restricted to taxonomic or systematic research only. The rise of modern high-throughput sequencing technologies will change biomonitoring applications and surveys significantly in the coming years. Following this, reference datasets such as ours will become essential for a correct identification of specimens sequenced as part of a metabarcoding study. This is especially true for the North Sea, a marine region that has been massively affected by cargo ship traffic, the exploitation of oil and gas resources, offshore wind parks, and in particular extensive long-term fisheries.</string>

Ferreira, Claudia Hollatz, Pedro A. Gomes, Ronaldo Sousa, Ascensão Ravara, Maria H. Costa, Filipe O. Costa\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe estuarine and coastal intertidal areas have a large number of benthic invertebrates, where the annelid polychaetes are one of the most representative classes and, therefore, important indicators of environmental quality in these ecosystems. Yet, these organisms have been poorly studied, in comparison to other taxa of similar ecological importance. Here we present a starting reference library of DNA barcodes for shallow water polychaetes of the southern European Atlantic coast, focusing on specimens from Portugal. \nResults\nCytochrome c oxidase subunit I DNA barcodes (COI-5P) from 164 specimens belonging to 51 morphospecies were analysed. Available published sequences from same species, genus, or family were added for comparison. The final dataset comprises 290 specimen records representing 79 morphospecies; however, interestingly, 99 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) were attributed. Only 47 BINs were considered concordant, where 1 morphospecies equals 1 BIN, and approximately a third of all BINs were considered discordant. Some morphospecies were assigned to multiple BINs, among which there were ecologically relevant species such as Hediste diversicolor (O.F. Müller, 1776) and Owenia fusiformis delle Chiaje, 1844 (7 and 5 BINs, respectively). Twenty-two BINs were singletons. \nSignificance\nThe high number of BINs compared to morphospecies found in this and other studies suggests a considerable amount of hidden diversity in this group. Reference libraries of DNA barcodes can be a key tool for a more extensive and rigorous documentation of the diversity of polychaetes, where numerous cryptic species have been found with the aid of molecular approaches.</string>

Morphologically-based taxonomy often fails to provide definitive evidence for differences among taxa. Molecular approaches such as DNA barcoding have the potential to assist with the identification of sponges. Here we evaluated sequence diversity at the COI gene locus as a tool for resolving species of New Zealand sponge. \nResults\nA total of 95 species were examined. Of these, we obtained sequences from 32 (success rate = 34 percent). In all cases, species were successfully discriminated. Sequence divergence within species was generally <1 percent, whereas divergences between species were >9 percent in all cases. However, divergences for a single species of Xestospongia were much higher (25 percent), and this could represent the presence of an undescribed species. \nSignificance\nWe conclude that DNA barcoding is a useful tool for identifying New Zealand sponges, particularly when used in combination with classical taxonomic techniques.]]></string>

Phylogenetic trees of COI and 16S rRNA gene sequences of giant clam samples from the Philippines were constructed using both neighbour joining and maximum likelihood approaches. \nResults\nBoth trees showed similar topology in which Tridacna and Hippopus formed two distinct clades. T. crocea, T. squamosa, T. maxima, T. costata, and Tridacna sp. YCT-2005 showed a monophyletic grouping under subgenus Chametrachea, confirming the recognized groupings of giant clams based on morphology. On the other hand, restriction site mapping based on the 16S rRNA gene showed a unique recognition site at 367-370 bp (5’AGCT3’) for T. maxima as opposed to Tridacna sp. YCT-2005. Alu I restriction endonuclease was identified as a candidate diagnostic enzyme to differentiate between these species. \nSignificance\nThis study confirmed the identity of giant clams found in the Philippines using molecular techniques. DNA barcoding can be a useful tool to identify different species of giant clams in the Philippines, which is needed for proper management and conservation of these endangered species.</string>

Radulovici, Sapphyre Gervais, Sujeevan Ratnasingham\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding has been shown to be an effective tool for species identification and discovery in marine eukaryotic organisms. Efforts to date have resulted in the addition of 20K marine species to the DNA barcode library. However, existing catalogues count nearly 226K eukaryotic species, and recent estimates suggest up to 2M species living in the oceans – a considerable distance to go before completing the library. Working in marine environments bears financial and logistical challenges beyond those for terrestrial or freshwater environments, resulting in difficulties to scale efforts. Such challenges make it necessary to be more considerate in establishing sampling strategies that would enable to capture and catalog the widest diversity. Tools like the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) have accelerated barcoding efforts by providing shared infrastructure for data storage and analysis of barcode data. We seek to take this effect further by integrating data from BOLD with other biodiversity data sources to build a federated database to guide future barcoding efforts. \nResults\nWe perform a gap analysis on the barcode library by integrating data from World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) with BOLD, GBIF, and the Catalogue of Life. Through this federated database we obtain the marine species yet to be barcoded and resolve synonymies. In addition, we identify biodiversity hotspots in the oceans where the greatest diversity of species has been collected. WoRMS shows 200K species of marine eukaryotes, 20K match those in BOLD, while 80K match those in GBIF. \nSignificance\nBOLD and other informatics platforms can enable tracking and analyzing marine biodiversity patterns. Taking advantage of these resources can help produce accurate data on marine biodiversity, leading to better predictions about global changes in the oceans. We provide an exemplar case by using these resources to develop a hit list of marine species to be barcoded and locations where they may be found.</string>

This group was once thought to be a single species with a distribution that spans the North American continent. Through the use of modern molecular techniques, including sequencing of the COI gene, over eighty distinct species have been identified. While most of these groups are endemic to the Great Basin, several of them possess much larger distributions that include previously glaciated habitats. This study is a comparative phylogeographic analysis of the major Hyalella lineages with a focus on glaciated North America. The goal is to characterize present-day distributions and patterns of molecular variation (using COI and ITS1 genes) in order to delineate the effects of Pleistocene vicariance and post-glacial dispersal. \nResults\nOver 3000 Hyalella were collected from across North America, and the distributions of nine major species were characterized. During the Pleistocene glaciations, these major lineages persisted within refugia south of the glacial limit or in ice-free areas of Beringia and subsequently dispersed through meltwater lake systems. Several genetic patterns were identified within these groups, including isolation by distance, demographic expansion, and long-distance colonization. These processes, in conjunction with dispersal from multiple refugia, have resulted in elaborate spatial patterns. Notably, the Great Lakes region has become a suture zone with habitats maintaining multiple Hyalella species. \nSignificance\nMolecular studies remain a critical tool in the characterization of species and the analysis of their demographic histories. The intricate genetic and spatial patterns of the Hyalella azteca complex indicate an elaborate history shaped by the Pleistocene glaciations. This study furthers our understanding of the recolonization of glaciated regions by freshwater invertebrates.</string>

However, this biogeographic region is a noticeable gap in world coverage for this vertebrate group on the barcode of life reference database. \nResults\nRecent biodiversity surveys in Jamaica, Dominican Republic, and Bonaire have documented almost half of the bat species diversity known from the Caribbean. Phylogenetic trees have low intraspecific but high interspecific differentiation, which indicate that DNA barcoding is a reliable method for identifying species of bats. With a broader geographic sampling across the Neotropics, there are also divergent lineages within widely distributed taxa suggesting the presence of cryptic species. \nSignificance\nThe biodiversity of bats in the Caribbean is at least 25 percent underestimated. This indicates that more study is needed to better document the ecological differences within and between insular and continental populations that are associated with this high level of genetic variation. In addition, the phylogeographic patterns of diversification warrant taxonomic revision and further scrutiny of the extent of morphological evolution.</string>

Ojeda, Alex Borisenko, Natalia Ivanova, Agustina Novillo, Cecilia Lanzone, Daniela Rodriguez, Pablo Cuello, Fernanda Cuevas, Pablo Jayat, Ricardo A. Ojeda\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nMuch of South America consists of diverse arid-semiarid regions characterized by high mammal endemism as a result of interplay between place and lineage histories. Rodents are important components in this scenario (with more than 2,200 species representing this most diverse order among mammals). The high diversity and complex evolutionary history has motivated researchers to study phylogenetic relationships and taxonomy, which have been under continuous revision. Despite being an important component of local faunas, rodents pose a major challenge for species-level diagnostics, due to complex phylogeographic history and obscure morphological features. We evaluated DNA barcodes as a tool for assessing the taxonomic and genetic diversity in the two major lineages of rodents: the “caviomorphs” and “sigmodontines”, from arid regions of Argentina. We analyzed 310 COI barcodes representing 32 species from 56 localities along the Argentinean Central Andes and lowland desert. \nResults\nThe NJ, MP, and ML trees provided clear distance-based separation between all currently recognized species in our dataset with >95 percent bootstrap support. No cases of sequence overlap between species were observed. Phyllotis xanthopygus showed divergences of up to 13.0 percent between geographically separated lineages and strong correspondence between genetic and geographic structure, suggesting cryptic speciation. Akodon spegazzinii and Tympanoctomys barrerae contained geographically separated clusters with up to 2.3 percent divergence. Most species demonstrated low COI variation (mean P-distance 0–2.2 percent) and no geographic pattern. Mean nearest-neighbor distances between congeneric species varied from 3.0–12.6 percent, except for two closely related forms within Euneomys. \nSignificance\nThe observed DNA barcode divergence patterns provide insights into the complex phylogeographic patterns and speciation scenarios in desert Andean rodents and highlight areas requiring in-depth taxonomic research, with potential implications in conservation and human health.]]></string>

This study is the first effort to build the DNA barcode library of bird species from Colombia. We focus on species listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) appendices, with the aim of contributing to global efforts to control illegal species trading. \nResults\nTo date, we have obtained sequences from 287 samples corresponding to 156 species, representing 48 percent of the CITES bird species registered from Colombia. The species analyzed are included in nine families, with Trochilidae and Psittacidae being the most represented. We obtained for the first time barcode records for 41 hummingbird, four parrot, two owl, and one hawk species; most of these species have distributions that are restricted to Colombia or to the northern Andes. Based on our results, we are able to recognize 85 percent of the species using the K2P distance criterion. In general, haplotypes from single species formed barcode groups that were clearly distinguishable from related species. However, seven species showed low genetic differences, and 16 species showed profound genetic differences. \nSignificance\nThis study is the first attempt to build the reference library of Colombian birds, one of the most trafficked groups in the world. Futhermore, the divergent specimens found are located in different mountain systems, which might suggest potential cryptic species.</string>

Tubaro, Dario A. Lijtmaer\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Andes mountains constitute one of the main factors promoting Neotropical diversification, but the role of other highland systems has been barely studied. The large, standardized barcode library of the birds of the region provides a unique opportunity for their analysis. In this context, we assessed the level of endemism in the avifauna of the Central Sierras in Córdoba, Argentina, to evaluate the effect of its geographic isolation from the Andes. There are 11 bird species that include subspecies endemic to the area, but none of them have been evaluated using molecular markers. \nResults\nWe studied 7 of these 11 species by obtaining the barcodes (and in some cases also cytochrome b sequences) of specimens from the Central Sierras and comparing them with those of other populations of these species in Argentina. The analysis of genetic divergence and haplotype networks, supported when possible through AMOVAs, indicated that in 3 of these species (Cinclodes atacamensis, Catamenia inornata, and Phrygilus unicolor) the population in the Central Sierras is differentiated from those of other regions of Argentina. In 3 of the remaining species (Muscisaxicola rufivertex, Asthenes modesta, and Phrygilus plebejus) there is a varying degree of differentiation, but results were not conclusive. Finally, there is no differentiation in the case of Sturnella loyca, the only species of this analysis that inhabits both high and low areas and therefore has a continuous distribution between the Central Sierras and the Andes. \nSignificance\nWhile further analyses including more molecular markers, morphology, and vocalizations are needed, some avian species were shown to have populations in the Central Sierras that are genetically differentiated, and therefore likely evolutionarily isolated, from other populations of southern South America. This clearly illustrates how the use of barcode sequences can constitute an initial step towards understanding evolutionary patterns and the processes generating them.</string>

Lijtmaer\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIn 2005, the Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales joined the All Birds Barcoding Initiative aiming to obtain the DNA barcodes of the birds of Argentina. As the project expanded its frontiers to Bolivia, in collaboration with local institutions, several cases of deep intraspecific divergence were revealed. Among them, that of the Red-crowned Ant Tanager (Habia rubica) stood out because of the strikingly high (around 7 percent) COI distance found between the allopatric populations of the Atlantic Forest in Argentina and the Yungas-Amazonia complex in Bolivia. Independently, a similar pattern of east-west divergence was found in Mexico and Middle America as part of the project to barcode the birds of Mexico and Guatemala. All this eventually led to the joint effort of Argentinian, Bolivian, Brazilian, and Mexican researchers to unveil the evolutionary history of H. rubica at a continental scale. \nResults\nWe explored the phylogeographic patterns of intraspecific diversity within H. rubica throughout its widespread but disjunct distribution from Mexico to Argentina. We performed phylogenetic, phylogeographic and genetic population analyses based on COI and other mitochondrial and nuclear genes, complemented with the assessment of coloration and behavioural differentiation. The evolutionary history of H. rubica through the last 5 million years seems to have been shaped by the uplift of the Northern Andes, the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, the establishment of the open vegetation corridor, and Quaternary climatic fluctuations. This resulted in levels of genetic, morphological, and behavioural divergence that justify considering at least three different species within this diversified lineage. \nSignificance\nOur study clearly illustrates how local screening of diversity through DNA barcodes can grow into large-scale, multi-institutional collaborative projects able to provide meaningful insights into the evolutionary history of certain regions and taxa of interest.</string>

In evidence of their utility, we have established a comprehensive DNA barcode library for the terrestrial animals and vascular plants of an intensively-studied area of the High Arctic, the Zackenberg Valley of Northeast Greenland. The resultant resource offers species-level resolution in describing biotic interactions among community members. Over the last few years, we have used it to document trophic links between predators and prey throughout this high-arctic food web. \nResults\nOverall, 425 terrestrial animal species and 160 vascular plant species were recorded by morphology-based techniques. DNA barcodes based on COI offered high resolution in discriminating among the local animal taxa, with rbcLa and ITS2 offering less resolution among vascular plants. When DNA barcodes were applied to resolve feeding associations among animals, the structure of the food web proved extremely complex, showing dense linking and no compartmentalization. \nSignificance\nOur description of the Zackenberg community comes with urgent implications both for our understanding of how arctic ecosystems are built and function, and of how they respond to current climate change. To comprehend the community-level consequences of rapid Arctic warming, we must embrace Arctic food web complexity, where impacts on single species may reverberate widely across the community.</string>

Erwin\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nCoextinction, the loss of one species as a consequence of the extinction of other species, is one of the main drivers of species loss on earth. Unfortunately, we have limited knowledge of how coextinctions propagate through trophic levels. One challenge to studying coextinctions is the identification of interacting species. Using DNA barcodes, we identified tri-trophic interactions along a tropical elevational gradient between host plants, insect herbivores, and phoretic mites. The resulting interaction networks were used to model cascades of extinctions for organisms present at different elevations under projected global warming. \nResults\nAlong an elevational gradient in Costa Rica (60 - 2800 m.a.s.l.), we determined the elevational distributions and obtained DNA barcodes (rbcL, ITS2) of plants from the order Zingiberales. These are the hosts of rolled-leaf beetles (Cephaloleia, Chrysomelidae), a charismatic group of insects that we are using to understand the complex process of coextinctions. To reconstruct interactions between plants and herbivores, we combined field records with novel molecular methods, identifying host plants using plant DNA extracted from insect gut contents. The DNA barcode COI revealed several cryptic insect herbivore species with narrow diets and elevational distributions. We are currently obtaining DNA barcodes (COI) from phoretic mites collected from beetles along this elevational gradient. Coextinction analyses show that high-elevation insect herbivores have a higher probability of extinction than insects in the lowlands. Future analyses will determine if phoretic mites show similar susceptibilities to extinction at different elevations. \nSignificance\nFast and accurate identifications of species and their trophic interactions using DNA barcodes are opening endless research avenues to understand key issues in ecology, evolution, and conservation, such as the process of coextinctions under projected global change.</string>

Each piece is carried back to the nest to line and separate brood cells arranged in a linear series in a hollow plant stem, decaying log, other tubular cavities or in the ground. Many leaf pieces (>15) are required per brood cell. Determining host-leaf preference is difficult, as it has depended on morphological identification from leaf fragments from nests or from observation of known bees cutting leaves from known plants. As such, data are poor on the plant species used by leaf-cutting bees. This missing detail in interpreting the ‘needs of bees’ offers valuable information for conservation by accounting for necessary (and potentially limiting) nesting materials. We use DNA barcoding and rbcL and ITS2 markers to compare the identity and diversity of leaves used by three species of above-ground nesting Megachile bees, one of which is economically important with nesting material requirements generally unknown. \nResults\nTo sample nests we used nestboxes set up throughout Toronto, Canada. Nests were opened, and one leaf piece from one cell per nest of the native Megachile pugnata (N=42 leaf pieces), the introduced M. rotundata (N=51) and M. centuncularis (N=59) were analyzed. From 25 plant families and 40 genera identified, M. rotundata used 19 and 26, respectively, M. pugnata 7 and 10, and M. centuncularis 11 and 19. Only three plant genera (Epilobium, Oenothera, Rosa) were collected by all three species. Megachile pugnata (42.9 percent of the time) and M. centuncularis (27.1 percent) visited Rosa most, while no plant genera were identified from M. rotundata samples more than 5 times. \nSignificance\nIn cities, landscape design and gardening impact leaf types available for different nesting bee species and these data can inform more complete conservation planning that accounts for foraging and nesting material requirements.]]></string>

Potts, Xin Zhou\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n Wild bees play a keystone role in the pollination of wild plants and cultivated crops and thereby help to maintain biodiversity and increase food production. Evidence of declines in wild pollinators and insect-pollinated plants requires high-throughput methods to monitor bee abundance and diversity, since the number of wild bee species per country ranges from hundreds to thousands. Morphological identification is inefficient because taxonomic expertise is scarce, and PCR-based metabarcoding is error-prone. \nResults\nWe used a metagenomic approach to identify and quantify bee species from bulk samples. Reference mitochondrial genomes from 48 bee species (9 genera) were assembled, the total DNA of each of 10 bulk samples (containing a total of 204 bees morphologically identified to 33 species) was shotgun-sequenced, and the sequence reads were mapped to the reference mitogenomes. This mitogenomic dataset showed high accuracy: successfully making 59 out of the 63 total species detections in the morphological dataset (i.e. 4 possible false negatives), plus making 6 detections not in the morphological dataset (possible false positives). PCR analysis suggests that these discrepancies were due to errors in the morphological identifications. The two datasets returned indistinguishable estimates of community structure and extrapolated species diversity, and read number per species was positively but weakly correlated with estimated biomass per species (R2=24.9 percent, p<0.001). By contrast, metabarcoding exhibited greater error on all counts. \nSignificance\nMitogenomic resequencing of bulk samples is highly promising for large-scale monitoring of wild bee communities and for assessing conservation interventions and can easily be extended to other taxa. Given their many practical and scientific advantages, mitogenomes deserve consideration as ‘super-barcodes’ for economically and socially important species.]]></string>

Ayesha Ali\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSymbiotic interactions between species are pervasive across all types of ecosystems and range across parasitic, commensal, and mutualistic relationships. Due to the prolific nature of these relationships, and the impact they have on the evolution of biodiversity and on ecosystem functioning, an understanding of coevolutionary history is critical to understanding evolutionary trends. Additionally, studying coevolution is practically important for understanding the context and likelihood of host switches in agricultural pests and in medical contexts. This paper will provide an overview of progress to date as well as future opportunities for DNA barcoding campaigns to contribute to our understanding of host-symbiont coevolution. \nResults\nTo date, barcode-based research on symbionts has primarily contributed towards our understanding of the diversity of species-like entities in symbiotic groups in regions ranging from sub-Arctic Canada to tropical ecosystems. Emerging methodologies yield unprecedented opportunities to gather host information through barcoding and metabarcoding of gut contents, reducing the need for painstaking rearing studies. Additionally, large datasets of standardized DNA sequences, ideally in combination with additional data from multi-gene and genomics-based projects, will contribute to building species-level phylogenies. These phylogenies, in combination with host association data, will enable testing of large-scale, novel coevolutionary hypotheses. We present results of such a comparison, using cophylogenies collected from published literature. Evidence of significant differences in the coevolutionary histories between ecto- and endo-symbionts was found, with host switching more likely in ecto-symbionts. \nSignificance\nThe ever-expanding availability of barcode and host association data provides opportunities for testing broad coevolutionary questions and for research into comparative patterns of coevolution. Through specimen barcodes and associated data, previously inaccessible lines of research are now becoming possible. Do host switching rates and levels of specialization/generalization differ across latitude zones? What impact do various biological traits have on host-symbiont coevolutionary history? What factors influence general coevolutionary patterns?</string>

Walker\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSubterranean ecosystems, such as caves and abandoned mines, are numerous (100,000+ exist in the western U.S. alone), yet understudied. In these environments, bats, through their nutrient-rich guano, have long been known as a foundation species, supporting a diverse food web including bacteria and arthropods that use guano as a food source, as well as predators that consume them. While bats are clearly important to this ecosystem, the degree to which their presence, species composition, and gut microbiota drive the diversity and stability of subterranean bacterial communities, and what happens when bat assemblages are significantly disrupted, is not known. \nResults\nWe have used a variety of barcoding and shotgun metagenome sequencing techniques to explore bacterial communities across multiple trophic levels (bat guano, associated arthropods) in bat-occupied subterranean sites (abandoned mines) within USA’s southern Arizona region. Our results to date support the hypothesis that bats, and their gut/guano microbiota, drive the bacterial biodiversity and composition of their immediate subterranean ecosystem. In particular, we have observed bat guano pile microbiota affecting arthropod gut bacterial composition, with detritivorous insect gut communities most closely mimicking the microbiota of guano from which it was isolated. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed a number of bacterial taxa persisting across the guano pile and arthropod gut niches. Finally, we observed bat species composition across different sites closely correlating with guano pile microbiome compositions. \nSignificance\nExploration of subterranean biomes is particularly relevant given that biodiversity within these ecosystems is threatened from a variety of sources, including invasive species, human activities, and disruptions to bat assemblages due to extinction, disease, habitat loss, and climate change. Bats themselves are increasingly recognized as an important reservoir for a number of human- and livestock- affecting bacterial zoonotic diseases, further highlighting the need to understand how their gut microbiota propagate through the environment.</string>

Roxo, Fausto Foresti, Claudio Oliveira\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe genus Rineloricaria is a group of Neotropical freshwater fish with a long and problematic taxonomic history, attributed to a high number of species and great similarity among them. For our work we used taxonomic information and different approaches to a single locus dataset to find species boundaries and to identify independent evolutionary units in an attempt to help with the problems associated with the analysis of distinct sources of knowledge. \nResults\nWe analyzed 228 samples assembled in 53 distinct morphospecies. However, traditional analyses, such as the barcode gap, failed to delineate them. In contrast, the General Mixed Yule-Coalescent (GMYC) analysis indicates the existence of 70 entities, confirming the identity of 43 of the 53 morphospecies, and showing that some species are genetically indistinct, while others probably are species complexes. The geographic data helped to understand deep genetic divergence among populations present in distinct river basins, and their ecological characterization suggested that species from headwater drainages have greater genetic segregation between populations. \nSignificance\nThe multiple approaches favor the recognition of species boundaries and allow the conclusion that Rineloricaria probably contains several undescribed species.</string>

Many fishes enter the Maumee River, an important tributary of Lake Erie, during spring to spawn, and therefore, the potential for interspecific trophic interactions to occur is high. As the timing of peak spawning activity is staggered depending on the species, there is a high potential for incoming predators to consume eggs and larvae of earlier-spawning species. Early life stages of fishes digest quickly in the gut contents of predator fish, making visual identification difficult. Therefore, predation on fish eggs and larvae in this system is not well documented, and in order to characterize the diet of fishes during this dynamic period, COI metabarcoding was conducted on a small subsample of the homogenized gut contents of 192 bottom-feeding and pelagic fishes. A 313 bp region of COI was amplified using primers from Leray et al. 2013 and sequenced using an Ion Torrent PGM next-generation sequencer. \nResults\n Results from the Maumee River gut content metabarcoding study provided insight into fish diet during this critical period and yielded possible instances of egg predation by bottom-feeding fishes. Sequences matching with small-bodied forage fish, chironomids, and insects were also detected in the diets of fishes. \nSignificance\nFuture research should attempt to reduce the degree of predator swamping from the gut lining of predators species. This study supports the use of gut content metabarcoding as an important tool to investigate previously unknown trophic interactions between species.</string>

Shuter, Robert H. Hanner\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nFood webs are important in understanding the structure, function, and behaviour of ecosystems, but methodological limitations have historically restricted the resolution of food webs, which impacts our understanding of food web structure. DNA barcoding has proven useful in identifying feeding interactions; however, few studies have evaluated whether dietary data produced using barcoding affect food web resolution or structure. We used predatory fish from Canadian boreal shield lakes to evaluate barcoding as a tool to increase dietary and food-web resolution and establish food-web structure. \nResults\nCompared to traditional morphological approaches, DNA barcoding yielded higher diversity and frequency of prey species from stomach contents and significantly increased prey diversity for individual predators and species, showing increased dietary resolution. Barcoding identified significantly more feeding links and prey taxa, indicating increased food web resolution. Barcode-based food webs had higher linkage density, higher proportions of possible feeding links, increased intraguild predation (omnivory), and more predator species coupling habitats, demonstrating changes to food-web structure. \nSignificance\nThe application of DNA barcoding for diet analysis has the potential to identify feeding interactions in an unprecedented and highly detailed manner, improving food web resolution and changing our understanding of food web structure in ways that have implications for their stability and dynamics. Highly resolved dietary data based on DNA barcodes have additional applications, such as inferring the behaviour of predators and observing variability in food web structure. By harnessing the natural foraging ability of predators to sample their environment, diet analysis based on DNA barcodes could also help identify the presence of species of interest, such as those that are invasive, rare, at risk, bioindicators, economically important, or difficult to detect. DNA barcoding applied to diet analysis has the potential to complement existing methods and improve our ability to establish structure, monitor species, and detect change in ecosystems.</string>

A greater understanding of the diets of marine fishes will greatly enhance our understanding of the biology of individual species, as well as improving our ability to understand and model the function of marine ecosystems. DNA barcoding, which allows the identification of individual species by analysis of specific short DNA sequences, shows great promise for species identification in a large variety of organisms from small amounts of DNA. The robust combination of freely-available DNA barcode databases (such as the Barcode of Life Data Systems database, or BOLD) and the robust data-generating power of high-throughout sequencing provides new opportunities for detailed dietary analyses. \nResults\nIn this study, we investigated the diet of four commercially important fishes from the South China Sea: Acanthopagrus latus, Pampus argenteus, Siganus argenteus, and Scomberomorus commerson. DNA was prepared from the gut contents of each species, and two distinct fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) gene, a small (130 bp) and a large (300 bp) amplicon, were amplified by PCR in the presence of predator DNA-specific blocking primers. After the amplicons from each species were tagged with a unique sequencing barcode, the pooled DNA amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, generating > 500,000 reads. Comparison of these data with mtCOI sequences in BOLD and Genbank yielded 24 prey taxa for Acanthopagrus latus, 15 prey taxa for Pampus argenteus, 46 prey taxa for Siganus argenteus, and 56 prey taxa for Scomberomorus commerso, identified to the species level. \nSignificance\nOur approach of combining Illumina MiSeq sequencing with blocking primers greatly enhances the speed and resolution of dietary analysis of marine fishes and could provide new insights into marine ecosystems.]]></string>

For that reason there is great concern for the conservation of aquatic life which is poorly understood. Many species have yet to be described or to be discovered also because recent ichthyological literature uncritically relies on earlier false data, thereby propagating errors. It is estimated that 9 percent of Indian freshwater fish are endemic; however, this number may be even higher. \nResults\nPartial sequences (652 bp) of the mitochondrial gene COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) were used to barcode 622 individuals, representing 12 orders, 41 families, 80 genera, and 103 species. The mean conspecific, congeneric, and confamiliar genetic distances were 0.3 percent, 10.78 percent, and 16.26 percent, respectively. Molecular species identification was in concordance with current taxonomical classification in 92 percent of cases; based on the neighbour-joining trees, in all but a few instances, members of a given genus clustered within the same clade. A total of twelve cases of deep intraspecific divergence (>3 percent) suggest the existence of cryptic species in the Godavari River. Only 10 percent of the fishes recorded were recorded in earlier studies based on morphology. On the other hand, 49 species were newly recorded for the Godavari River. Various approaches used in different studies led to the inflated and unrealistic number of 220 fish species for the Godavari River, which indicates extensive misidentification. We used this survey of genetic diversity as independent calibration of current taxonomic resolution within the Godavari fish fauna to reveal key areas of uncertainty whenever discrepancies between genetic data and morphologically based taxonomy arise. \nSignificance\nThis study can serve as a good example demonstrating the need of complementary taxonomical procedures to understand the diversity of life. Overall, the results showed the usefulness of DNA barcodes for cataloguing the Godavari river fish species and for identifying groups that deserve further taxonomic attention.]]></string>

The eastern part of Java and Bali islands are located at the margin of Sundaland, next to the Wallace line that marks the range distribution boundaries of most of the primary freshwater fishes from a continental origin (e.g. Cypriniformes, Siluriformes). Widespread species of primary freshwater fishes are few in Java and Bali but potentially informative on the timing and geography of the colonization of this peripheral area of Sundaland. The biogeography of the Sundaland ichthyodiversity is still poorly understood, and the spatio-temporal dynamic of colonization of the peripheral islands of Sundaland is still unknown. \'nResults\n Three species with widespread distribution have been sampled across nearly 30 sites throughout Java and Bali islands. A total of 100 specimens of Channa gachua (Perciformes, Channidae), 123 specimens of Glyptothorax platypogon (Siluriformes, Sisoridae), and 121 specimens of Puntius binotatus (Cypriniformes, Cyprinidae) were sequenced and analyzed. For each species, mean intra-specific distances were high ranging from 1.31 percent in P. binotatus to 3.18 percent in C. gachua, and seven to eight allopatric lineages were observed with maximum pairwise distance ranging from 5.3 to 6.1 percent among lineages. Patterns of distribution of this cryptic diversity are congruent among species, suggesting that a common history is at the origin of the distribution of the genetic diversity for the three species analyzed. Molecular calibrations suggest that the initial diversification of those mitochondrial lineages happened during the early Pleistocene. \nSignificance\n The present study highlights that the evolutionary history of the Javanese and Balinese freshwater fishes has been influenced by the fragmentation of the landscapes during the Pleistocene, likely as a result of the volcanic activity in the area during the Pleistocene that promoted the rise of volcanic arches.</string>

Ordonez, Jacqueline Pereda, Jom Acebes\n\nAbstract:\nThe Philippines is home to the highest number of marine species per square area in the world, gaining the distinction of being the center of marine biodiversity in the world. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the hotspots in terms of marine conservation due to numerous threats to its biodiversity. This is compounded by the absence of a comprehensive taxonomic listing of marine species in the country. Here, we present our recent results at the NFRDI-Genetic Fingerprinting Laboratory on the application of DNA barcoding to discover new records of aquatic organisms in the Philippines. We established the first records of rare and regulated species such as the recently resurrected beaked whale, Mesoplodon hotaula stranded in Southern Philippines; a recently resurrected giant clam, Tridacna noae; and the reef manta ray, Manta alfredi. We established the first report in the country of two possible invasive species, the tilapia flowerhorn Cichlasoma urophthalmus sampled from fish ponds in Bulacan as well as the black chin tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron in Manila Bay. We provide the first direct evidence of the presence of mobula ray Mobula japonica sampled from an illegal shipment of dried shark meat and bones. Finally, we also present recent discovery of new fish species in the country by other collaborating authors. Our results highlight the Philippines as truly a marine biodiversity haven because of the still high rate of discovery of new species and that conserving it should take paramount importance. It also highlights the important role of DNA barcoding as a powerful tool in species discovery and conservation in a marine biodiversity hotspot.</string>

Hebert\n\nAbstract\nBackground:\nA comprehensive database of COI sequences, linked to authoritatively identified voucher specimens for all fishes, promises a significant advance for fisheries science. Aside from providing identifications for whole specimens, barcode analysis opens up new possibilities – essentially barcodes can be used to gain identifications during any stage of development or when examining fragmentary or processed remains. The identification of immatures is one area of fisheries research that will particularly benefit from a DNA barcoding system. Over 2500 immature specimens were collected as part of a study that spans ten years of collecting early larvae of fishes spawning pelagic eggs on the inshore shelf, within 5km of the coast, along a short section of the KwaZulu-Natal coastline, about 50km south of Durban, South Africa. This study further examined 3216 adult individuals, representing 915 fish species from South African waters. \nResults\nUsing BOLD’s library for COI sequences for adults, 89 percent of all larval fishes were identified to species level. About 60 percent of the unmatched sequences could be assigned to genus, family, or order level. Only 4 perccent of all sequences could not be assigned to any taxonomic group. Among all immature individuals, there were representatives of 450 species. Accumulation curves based on inference of phylogenetic diversity indicate near-completeness of the collecting efforts. The entire set comprising both adult and larval fish represents about 43 percent of all fish species known to occur in South African waters. In addition, it includes 189 species previously not recorded for this region. \nSignificance\nThe early life-history stages of fishes are poorly known, impeding acquisition of the identifications needed to monitor larval recruitment and year-class strength. In this study, we identified almost 90 percent of the fish larvae in our collections, demonstrating both power and completeness of the DNA barcode reference library of fishes that is available after ten years of FishBOL.</string>

Phytosanitary policy actions and on-farm pest management decisions are both informed by the identification of pest specimens. DNA barcoding can assist these identifications by overcoming limitations of morphology-based methods such as the lack of taxonomic resources, knowledge, and/or expertise. However, for DNA barcoding to address phytosanitary goals, barcode reference libraries must contain representatives of known pest species. We compiled a checklist of arthropod plant pests of global origin that includes species of regulatory and/or economic significance. Here, we present a gap analysis of the DNA barcode library coverage for this checklist, contrast it with one conducted two years previous, and discuss some of the current challenges facing the further implementation of DNA barcoding for phytosanitary applications. \nResults\nAltogether, 68 percent (638/943) of species on our pest checklist are represented by specimens with associated barcode sequences on BOLD; this represents an increase of 10 percent from two years prior. Over the last two years, 521 species had newly generated barcode sequences, while 404 had no new additions, and 18 lost sequences, presumably due to curatorial processes. Although these additions resulted in better barcode coverage across the checklist, only 41 percent (387/943) of species are currently represented by 10 or more barcodes. \nSignificance\nThe potential phytosanitary applications of DNA barcoding are frequently invoked to justify DNA barcode research. As such, it is important that the wider barcode research community ensures that pests of varying economic and regional importance are adequately represented in reference libraries. The current gap analysis suggests that library coverage for many common pest species is progressing; however, gaps still exist. By providing a checklist of pest species, Plant Pest Barcoding aims to address practical library deficiencies, by highlighting gaps and guiding further library development.</string>

Larvae appear to be strictly monophagous on a single species of orchid, and thus the moth species has few and highly localized populations where the orchid host is in sufficient abundance. \nResults\nDNA barcoding of all immature stages (eggs, larvae, pupae) confirmed the presence of a single species on the orchid host forming a compact BIN distinct from 14 other Paralobesia BINs. Comparison with barcodes of other Paralobesia species showed that occurrence of cypripediana has been overestimated and that many historical records and all barcode records of the species were based on misidentifications of other Paralobesia species. Barcoding host-based specimens of cypripediana had a cascading effect on rectifying the identification of nearly all Paralobesia barcode records in BOLD. This included the correct association of the grape berry moth, Paralobesia viteana, a pest of grapes and vineyards. Adults of cypripediana were successfully reared after 5 years of trials. Evidence of past occurrences of cypripediana in areas where the host plant no longer occurs was obtained from old herbarium plant specimens. \nSignificance\nBarcoding can uncover evidence of misidentifications among confusing or cryptic species, reveal unsuspected species, help resolve taxonomic synonymies, and in absence of the morphologically diagnostic adult stage confirm range occurrences from immature stages.</string>
    <string name="id62">Presenting Author: Ashfaq, Muhammad\n\nContact: mashfaq@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Muhammad Ashfaq\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAlthough numerous insect species impact plants, some are particularly important because of their broad distribution, invasive nature, and capacity to transmit diseases. The identification of species in four major groups of pest insects (aphids, scales, thrips, whiteflies) is a challenge due to their small size and cryptic morphology. Analysis of DNA barcode (COI-5ʹ) sequences and the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system has helped to discriminate closely related species in these groups. \nResults\nDNA barcoding was employed to identify species of whitefly (Bemisia tabaci complex), thrips, aphids, and the mango scale insect and to analyze their diversity in Pakistan. Barcode analysis of 593 whiteflies revealed the presence of six BINs. Integration of these records with another 173 from GenBank revealed 15 BINs in the B. tabaci complex. COI-3ʹ analysis from the corresponding B. tabaci lineages supported the BINs, indicating that B. tabaci is a complex of multiple species. Barcode analysis of 471 thrips revealed 56 species. Sequences for three major pest species (Haplothrips reuteri, Thrips palmi, Thrips tabaci) and one predatory thrips (Aeolothrips intermedius) showed deep intraspecific divergences, strongly suggesting that each is a cryptic species complex. Likewise, the analysis of 662 aphids revealed 42 species with a deep split in the barcodes of Rhopalosiphum padi, leading specimens of this aphid species to be assigned to two BINs. The mango scale, Drosicha mangiferae, has an uncertain status in Pakistan because it has also been reported as D. stebbingi. Barcode analysis of scale populations in Pakistan revealed the presence of a single barcode lineage, indicating that the species are likely synonyms. \nSignificance\nDNA barcode analysis of four important pest groups was effective in revealing cryptic species complexes and resolving species identities. This barcode library will aid pest control by easing past problems in identification.</string>

A detailed overview of species interactions and dependencies in an ecosystem can help monitor changes in functional relationships. The identification of ecosystem players to the species level, especially arthropods collected from fields, is a major task. DNA barcoding can potentially help in the identification task and can be an important tool for rapid specimen identification. In this study, arthropods (pests, predators, parasitoids, neutral insects) were collected from rice paddies of Zhejiang province, China. Standard DNA barcoding using the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was first performed to establish a reference barcode library. We further designed two pairs of primers for amplifying short sequences to enable detection of partially digested prey species. We then used Ion Torrent Amplicon sequencing to analyse the DNA extracted from the whole body of 4 spider species. Using the DNA barcode library, we determined the prey species composition in each spider sample. We assume that DNA sequences besides those of the spiders were those of the prey species. \nResults\nWe established a reference barcode library including 356 records representing 140 species in 45 families. Based on the library, we found that the average interspecies Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) genetic distance was 0.304 (0.004-0.474) and intraspecies distance was 0.004 (0.000-0.033). The average genetic distance was 75-fold higher between species than within species. Using the two pairs of primers, we could amplify 85.0 percent and 93.8 percent of the species represented in our COI barcode vector library that was constructed for the evaluation. We are now using the second pair for sequencing. \nSignificance\nThis paper describes the application of DNA barcoding to analyse food web relationships among arthropods in agricultural fields, through sampling and extracting the DNA within predator species.</string>

The biodiversity of naturally occurring generalist predators, such as spiders or ground-living beetles, has been positively associated with pest control in intensively managed agro-ecosystems. However, our ability to successfully predict ecological functions, such as pest regulation by natural enemies, requires more direct and mechanistic insight. Disentangling trophic interactions among service-providing organisms in agricultural landscapes will afford a direct and holistic view of the processes determining ecosystem services’ achievement. In order to elucidate factors affecting biological control of pests, we built semi-quantitative trophic networks of a major group of insect generalist predators (carabid beetles) by using a molecular metabarcoding approach. \nResults\nGut contents from 500 individuals of 13 carabid species were collected in 6 intensively managed wheat and oilseed rape fields and analyzed with a combination of plant and animal universal primers. The most significant variation in carabids’ trophic choice was explained by the crop type and the field identity (p<0.01). This variation was mainly expained by differences in the consumption of non-pest organisms, including other natural predators (i.e. disservice). Indeed, predation on non-pest prey was two times higher in wheat crop compared to oilseed rape (p<0.01). Finally, we observed a significant effect of field identity on major properties of the carabids’ trophic network structure (nestedness, linkage density, and connectance, p<0.01). \nSignificance\nThe physical mosaic of the agricultural landscape plays a major role in the trophic behavior of insect generalist predators, with significant consequences for the success of biological control. This finding is important because of the urgency to identify concrete actions for sustainable crop protection. It also emphasizes the value of DNA barcoding-based approaches for tackling questions of ecological, economic, and societal relevance.]]></string>

Jonathan Davies, Kowiyou Yessoufou, Olivier Maurin, Michelle Van der Bank\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nInvasive species are detrimental ecologically and economically. Their negative impacts in Africa are extensive and call for a renewed commitment to better understand the correlates of invasion success. In this study, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the species pool using the core DNA barcoding regions (rbcLa and MatK). Using this phylogeny, we explored several putative drivers of species invasion among woody, non-native trees and shrubs. \nResults\nWe found that non-native species generally have longer flowering duration compared to native species, are generally hermaphroditic, and their dispersal is mostly abiotically mediated. We also revealed that non-native species that have become invasive are less closely related to native trees and shrubs than their non-invasive, non-native counterparts. Non-natives that are more closely related to the native species pool may be more likely to possess traits suited to the new environment in which they find themselves, and thus have a greater chance of establishment. However, successful invaders are less closely related to the native pool, indicating evidence for competitive release or support for the vacant niche theory. \nSignificance\nNon-native species in southern Africa are characterized by a suite of traits, including long flowering times, a hermaphroditic sexual system, and abiotic dispersal, which may represent important adaptations promoting establishment. We suggest that differences in the evolutionary distances separating the native species pool from invasive and non-invasive species might help resolve Darwin’s Naturalization Conundrum.</string>

Gonzalez, Beatriz Salgado, Roy Gonzalez, Ángela María Mendoza, Elkin Tenorio, Jhon Nieto, Sandra Medina, Hernando Garcia\n\nAbstract:\nBackground: The evolutionary diversity encompassed in a community reflects the assembly rules that allow the coexistence of species and is an indicator of the response capacity of ecosystems to change. The Chocó biogeographic region on the Pacific coast of Colombia is one of the world\'s biodiversity hotspots, with nearly 11,000 species of vascular plants that remain poorly known. In this study, we assess the taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity of trees in four 1-ha plots from a REDD+ initiative. \nResults\nWe found 360 species of trees. Phylogenetic diversity was measured based on four DNA barcode sequence regions (RbcLa, TrnH-psbA, trnL, and ITS) obtained for 120 species and completed with 200 barcodes from GenBank. Taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity patterns were decoupled, pointing to areas of particular evolutionary history and functional significance for conservation. \nSignificance\nThe conservation value of forests should consider not only the capacity to stock carbon but also all other dimensions of biodiversity. DNA barcoding constitutes an efficient tool to assess the evolutionary history of communities and understand the assembly rules that sustain biodiversity.</string>

We applied DNA barcoding for species-level identification and investigated the bee species diversity on B. napus in three agroclimatic zones of Punjab state (Northern India). \nResults\nIn all, 11 bee species comprising 5 new species records (one for India and four for the Punjab), representing 7 genera, 5 subfamilies, and 4 families of the superfamily Apoidea were barcoded and are available on BOLD (Barcode of Life Data Systems). The relative bee abundance results showed that Apis mellifera was significantly the highest (22.6 percent), whereas Colletes lacunatus was the least abundant species (1.1
        percent). Appraisal of average ranks assigned to the zones based on 12 diversity indices (species number indices, proportional abundance indices, evenness and dominance indices), absolute abundance, and species richness revealed that the bee communities in the central plain and sub-montane undulating zones were equally diverse. The bee communities in the western zone were the least diverse. Our results highlighted the significant stake of non-Apis species (7) in overall bee assemblages in B. napus- centered agro-ecosystems. The differences in bee species richness, abundance, and distribution were apparently influenced by local resource abundance, weather, and ecological disturbances. \nSignificance\nOur study is a pioneering work in our region, having succeeded in utilizing DNA barcoding for investigating bee communities from an ecological perspective. The information generated on the region and crop-specific species diversity as well as DNA barcodes of bee species will serve as baseline data, facilitating bee identification for further accounting of bee diversity, pollination efficiency of newly recorded species, documentation of shifts or declines in species composition, and for initiating habitat management programmes for species showing dwindling abundance.</string>
    <string name="id502">Presenting Author: Donoso, David\n\nContact: david.donosov@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: David Donoso\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAnts are conspicuous members of tropical soil food webs, where most plant detritus is recycled. The mechanisms that shape ant community structure remain elusive. But species interactions (such as competition) and environmental filters, expected to affect ant distribution, are mediated by ant traits. However, because ant traits determine species attributes such as local abundance, dispersal ability, growth, and generation time, the genetic variability within lineages should mirror community composition. COI barcodes are standard pieces of mitochondrial DNA that provide us with both an identification tool and a measure of genetic variability. Here, we explore how within-taxon haplotype diversity correlates with different ant traits and helps to explain community composition. \nResults\nFor example, we expect more haplotype variability among smaller ants with fast generation times. Increased variability is also expected among canopy ants with more profound ecological barriers. On the contrary, we expect less variability among abundant and widely distributed ants with less genetic isolation and more gene flow. Similarly, long-legged ants with high dispersal ability (increased migratory potential) are expected to show less genetic variability. \nSignificance\nWe provide the first links between within-taxon barcode variability and community structure.</string>

Adamowicz, Karl Cottenie\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nA longstanding area of debate in community ecology has centered on niche theory versus neutral theory. While the debate has resulted in observations supporting each theory, theoretical frameworks have largely neglected the role of evolution. By incorporating genetic diversity data into community analyses it may be possible to determine under what conditions niche and neutral processes play a greater role in shaping a community and whether the genetic structure of a community impacts this. Barcode data will improve species-level identifications and allow researchers to incorporate evolutionary history into analyses. To test whether grouping species by using coarse taxonomic resolution masks the relationship between taxonomic composition and environmental variables, we characterized 21 stream invertebrate communities focusing on the five most abundant aquatic insect orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera, plus the often-neglected class Oligochaeta. \nResults\nWe found that the proportion of community composition variability explained by the environment decreased or did not change with increasing taxonomic resolution (family, genus, and DNA barcode cluster levels). This suggests ecological inter-changeability of closely related taxa in this system, given the environmental variables we measured. \nSignificance\nThese findings suggest that ecological filtering may play a greater role at a family level than a species level. We will explore how estimates of variation in genetic diversity can improve our understanding of the role of niche and neutral processes. Determining the effect genetic diversity and species diversity have on spatial dynamics will greatly improve our understanding of community dynamics. In the face of great environmental change, due to climate change and other anthropogenic factors, understanding why species live in certain areas will help provide information about the chance of local species extinctions, changes to species viability and recovery, and predictions of how the communities will shift. Such information will also help focus conservation efforts.</string>

In the marine environment, the taxonomy and distribution of most organisms are poorly known. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex processes, involving all species interacting within communities, reliable and accessible taxonomic tools to identify species in broad community-level datasets are needed. This study aims to document the species diversity of benthic marine communities in British Columbia, Canada, and to establish a molecular inventory including DNA barcodes to enable confident identification of species for ecological research. \nResults\nIntertidal and subtidal sites were sampled across 700 km of BC coastlinem and 2000 specimens were collected. For marine shelled gastropods and brachyuran crabs, we used a high-throughput integrative taxonomic approach to generate fast and accurate species hypotheses based on the phylogenetic species concept. To date, 57 species have been delimited, including cryptic species that can cause difficulty in ecological studies because of taxonomic uncertainty. Rarefaction curves suggest 80-100 percent of the actual diversity of macro-species living in sampled habitats was collected. However, the compilation of historic reports of species presence suggests that many micro- and deep-sea species remain to be sampled in the North East Pacific. Overall, the four habitat types analyzed contained distinct species assemblages. Evidence of nonrandom co-occurrence patterns indicative of ecological relationships or reflecting preference for certain environmental conditions were observed in 35 species. \nSignificance\nThis is the first study to assess marine species richness and ecological patterns in BC using a modernized approach to species hypotheses including the incorporation of DNA barcode data. The high-throughput taxonomic approach used should bring new opportunities for ecologists studying complex natural communities. The molecular inventory of native macro-species generated provides baseline data and will facilitate monitoring for invasive species in BC.</string>

Brosi\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nTraditional microscopic identification of pollen is slow and of limited taxonomic resolution. By contrast, DNA barcoding can enhance both the speed and the accuracy of pollen identification. Recent technological advances have enabled us to develop a method for identifying pollen in mixed-species samples, through mixed-amplicon sequencing of one of the standard DNA barcoding markers (chloroplast rbcLa) on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Using pollen samples of known composition, we addressed the following questions: (1) How many species can be detected within a sample? (2) To what extent is this affected by taxonomic relatedness? (3) How rare can a species be in a sample before it becomes undetectable? \nResults\nFirstly, we show proof-of-concept for plastid-based DNA meta-barcoding by demonstrating that the plastid barcoding marker rbcL can be amplified and sequenced from mixed-species pollen samples. We were able to detect species in mixtures comprising up to nine species. We were also able to distinguish closely related species and rare species in mixtures. Subsampling of sequence reads enabled us to determine the sequencing depth required to detect all species present in mixtures of varying complexities. \nSignificance\nWe predict that DNA meta-barcoding of mixed-pollen samples will transform a wide range of fields, including pollination biology, allergen monitoring, and forensics, by enhancing both the speed and accuracy of species identification. Future advances in this work, including standardization of the bioinformatics pipeline, development of methods to correct for bias in ptDNA copy number and amplification bias, and inclusion of multiple DNA barcoding loci, would enable routine use of these methods in a range of fields.</string>

Riusech, Karen Goodell, Reed M. Johnson\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThough useful in many areas of research, the difficulty of microscopic palynology, or pollen analysis, has resulted in limited implementation. Metabarcoding, a relatively novel approach, could make palynology less onerous, but improved understanding of the scope and quantitative capacity of various plant metabarcode regions is needed to ensure that such applications are accurate and precise. We applied metabarcoding, targeting the ITS2, matK, and rbcL loci, to characterize six samples of pollen collected by honey bees, Apis mellifera. In addition, samples were analyzed by microscopic palynology. \nResults\nWe found significant rank-based associations between the relative abundance of pollen types within our samples as inferred by the two methods. \nSignificance\nOur findings suggest metabarcoding data from plastid loci, as opposed to ribosomal loci, are more reliable for quantitative characterization of pollen assemblages. Additionally, multi-locus metabarcoding of pollen may be more reliable quantitatively and qualitatively, underscoring the need for discovering novel barcodes and barcode combinations optimized for molecular palynology.</string>

Understanding the reasons for declines and providing conservation guidance requires detailed information on the habitat requirements and foraging preferences of pollinating insects. Pollinator foraging can be tracked using pollen DNA metabarcoding. Pollen is retrieved from the bodies of insects, from pollen loads, or honey. DNA is extracted, amplified using the rbcL and ITS2 DNA barcode markers, and sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Key to the ability to identify unknown DNA sequences is a comprehensive DNA barcode reference library. We have DNA barcoded all of the native flowering plants of the UK along with non-native, horticultural, and agricultural plants important for pollinators. \nResults\nWe present three case studies. 1: Honey bee foraging has been assessed by characterising the floral composition of honey collected throughout the UK. This provides a general overview of commonly used plant species. 2: We extend this to investigate honey bee floral preferences in a spatial and temporal context for hives located within the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Plant species composition of pollen loads and honey has been identified throughout the year. We relate the plants used to those available for foraging using flower maps of the entire botanic garden created from ground and UAV surveys. 3: Hoverfly foraging has been investigated by sampling a range of species from grassland communities to compare floral constancy across individuals, species, and sites. \nSignificance\nPollen DNA metabarcoding provides a powerful method for tracking pollinator foraging and can be used to assess floral preferences, habitat requirements, and nutritional needs. This can be used to help maintain resilient wild and agricultural ecosystems.</string>

Expert knowledge and reference collections are essential to identify pollen origin through light microscopy. Pollen identification through molecular sequencing and DNA barcoding has been proposed as an alternative approach, but assessment of mixed-pollen samples originating from multiple plant species is still a tedious and error-prone task. A new strategy to tackle this is to use next-generation sequencing for assessment of complete assemblages without manual separation. Especially, new sequencing devices allow high numbers of samples to be processed in parallel, to the benefit of cost- and labour-efficiency. \nResults\nWe thus developed molecular protocols to assess the biodiversity of pollen samples with ITS2 amplicons by different sequencing devices (454, MiSeq) and an automatic classification pipeline designed for such high throughput. In general, sequencing resulted in deeper assignments and more identified taxa compared to light microscopy. Abundance estimations from sequencing data were correlated with counted abundances through light microscopy. Simulation analyses of taxon specificity and sensitivity indicate that 96 percent of taxa present in the database are correctly identifiable at the genus level and 70 percent at the species level. Currently, the coverage of the reference database is highly variable, exemplarily for US states ranging between 78.2 – 88.4 percent (median: 85.3 percent) of known genera. Thus the major limitation of the approach is low coverage for less well-sampled bioregions. \nSignificance\nWe successfully applied the method in a variety of ecological studies with nest provisions of social and solitary bees, rigid corbicular pollen collections, pollinator surface swabs, and honey. The obtained data was well suited to answer our specific hypotheses and to identify diet and foraging patterns. Concluding, metabarcoding presents a useful workflow to assess plant origins of mixed-pollen samples in ecology without requiring specialised palynological expert knowledge.</string>
    <string name="id155">Presenting Author: Gous, Annemarie\n\nContact: gousa@arc.agric.za\n\nAuthors: Annemarie Gous, Jurgens J. de Bruin, Sandi Willows-Munro, Connal Eardley, Dirk Swanevelder\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIncreasingly, studies are employing DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches to identify different organisms in environmental samples. However, this approach in pollination biology is still lacking, with available barcoding data only assessing fresh pollen. NGS provides an easier, faster way to generate large volumes of data on pollen sampled directly from bees, eliminating the need for separating the pollen grains by taxon prior to sequencing. In this study, DNA barcoding is combined with Illumina NGS to provide taxonomic classification for pollen sampled from one species of indigenous, solitary bee that was collected across South Africa over a 93-year period. Three genomic regions were studied: the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2) and the rbcL gene. A bioinformatic workflow using custom-made databases for the entire internal transcribed spacer region and rbcL was developed. \nResults\nIn total, 22 mixed-origin pollen samples were assessed. Samples represent eight decades, spanning over 90 years, of bee collection. Samples from as far back as 1910 were successfully sequenced and classified. Species-level delimitation of pollen was possible for all genomic regions, with higher confidence at family level. \nSignificance\nThis is the first time that samples from a historic insect collection have been used in studying pollen origins using NGS and DNA barcoding techniques. This approach provides a historical perspective on how floral choice in indigenous bees changed over time and insights into the effects that land use and climate change have on bee-plant interactions in regions with high levels of oligolectic bees species.</string>

While proof-of-concept of DNA metabarcoding of pollen has been shown by multiple research groups, several outstanding questions remain. In this presentation we 1) synthesize results presented at this symposium; and 2) outline results from work in our group including shotgun sequencing, purification of non-pollen DNA from samples, and other topics; and 3) outline future research directions for DNA barcoding of pollen. \nResults\nWe present preliminary results on shotgun sequencing, which holds promise for highly resolved genetic identifications of pollen, but remains highly limited due to lack of reference samples. We also present a method to remove non-pollen DNA from samples, while keeping pollen interior DNA intact. We synthesize the findings presented in the symposium to give an overview of the field of DNA barcoding of pollen. \nSignificance\nDNA metabarcoding of pollen is in its infancy but is rapidly evolving. Building an understanding of the current state of the field, technical hurdles that need to be overcome, and strategic directions for the future is critical for realizing the transformative potential of this technology.</string>
    <string name="id390">Presenting Author: Vieira, Pedro Emanuel Ferreira dos Reis\n\nContact: pedroefrvieira@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Pedro Vieira, Nuno Gomes, David M Holdich, Henrique Queiroga, Filipe O Costa\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAlthough Dynamene is a species-poor genus of sphaeromatid isopods, members of this genus are abundant in rocky shores of the Northeast Atlantic, where they are represented by 3 species: Dynamene bidentata, Dynamene edwardsi, and Dynamene magnitorata. Because isopods lack larval stages, and therefore have limited dispersal ability, their populations are presumed more susceptible to isolation. We examined DNA barcode diversity in this group, in rigorously identified specimens collected along European and Moroccan Atlantic rocky shores, including the British Isles and Macaronesia. \nResults\nAs expected, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI-5P) DNA barcodes clearly discriminated between the 3 monophyletic species clusters (average distance of 24 percent), confirming their morphology-based identifications. However, within D. edwardsi, 4 deeply divergent lineages were present, displaying genetic distances between 15 percent to 22 percent, hence strongly suggesting the existence of a cryptic species complex. Sequences of the 18S rRNA nuclear gene essentially confirmed the complete sorting among the 4 lineages, although genetic distances were much lower. The most salient finding, however, was that populations within a lineage were not grouped by geographic vicinity, but instead by the known island emergence timing. For example, populations as geographically close as Porto Santo and Madeira split into two lineages displaying as much as 22 percent genetic distance. Upon phylogenetic reconstruction, lineage branching depth matched closely the sequential time of island emergence, with the Porto Santo/continental Portugal branching most deeply, followed by Morocco/Gran Canaria and finally Madeira/La Palma. \nSignificance\nDNA barcodes unravelled a complex of 3 probable cryptic species within D. edwardsi and a remarkable match between the sequential genesis of the Macaronesian islands and the phylogeographic structure of this passively dispersed marine invertebrate. These findings are highly significant for the investigation of comparative patterns of evolution and speciation of marine invertebrates in Macaronesia and contribute to the understanding of speciation processes in the marine environment.</string>

Santos, Harilaos Lessios, Allen Collins\n\nAbstract:\n Background\nHydroids are relatively simply marine invertebrates and are widely spread across all oceans, both in shallow and deep waters. The superfamily Plumularioidea is one of the most common and species rich, comprising benthic colonies, mainly plumose, sometimes attaining considerable sizes. Many Plumularioidea are believed to have large geographic distributions. However, few diagnostic morphological characters are used to categorize its taxa, a consequence of their structural simplicity, and the recent use of molecular characters has uncovered cryptic taxa. Furthermore, the high levels of morphological plasticity that hydrozoans display often make it difficult to differentiate intraspecific from interspecific variation. \nResults\nWe generated DNA barcodes using mitochondrial 16S and COI markers for about 800 different Plumularioidea specimens. This almost triples the number of Genbank records presently available online. We focused sampling effort across the Northeast Pacific and throughout the North Atlantic (in both shallow and deep waters), but we also generated molecular data for other marine areas worldwide. We summarize the main findings of our integrative taxonomic approach to better understand the systematics, phylogeography, and speciation patterns in more than 150 species of Plumularioidea belonging to 19 nominal genera. \nSignificance\nWe uncovered significant new and cryptic diversity at the taxonomic level of species and genera, but also evidence for few cases of synonymy and of species distributed widely in both shallow and deep waters. Remarkably, few species indicate the maintenance of genetic connectivity across the Atlantic. Other species appear to have taken advantage of boat traffic to propagate to remote locations. It is also noteworthy that most lineages of shallow-water hydroids from the Azores arrived in the archipelago in distinct colonizing episodes originating from the NE Atlantic, contradicting the main influence of the Gulf Stream current into the area presently. We will further assess the effectiveness and efficiency of 16S or COI for DNA barcoding of hydroids.</string>

Wilson, Jason Kennington\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nChromodoris is a genus of colourful sea slug that sequesters toxins from its prey and is widely distributed throughout the Indo-Pacific. However, morphological similarities between congenerics, coupled with an incomplete knowledge of species ranges, make species identification particularly difficult in this genus. The true diversity of Chromodoris in the Indo-Pacific is unknown, and this study employs DNA barcoding to aid in species delimitation and the discovery of hidden diversity. A portion of this project will focus on diversity in the poorly-understood northwestern region of Western Australia, a biodiversity hotspot known for intensive mining development. \nResults\nThis work presents a biodiversity baseline for Chromodoris species in the Indo-Pacific, with an emphasis on Western Australia, using the barcode region of COI. A total of 181 individuals from 16 morphospecies were sampled from wide geographic areas in the Indo-Pacific, spanning entire species ranges, and providing crucial insight into species-level relationships in this genus. We also use COI data to explore phylogeographic patterns in two widespread species and highlight an apparent rapid radiation of Chromodoris. \nSignificance\nDocumenting biodiversity is essential for identifying species in need of conservation management, and is particularly important in areas with high species diversity and endemism. This study fills in significant sampling gaps in the Indian Ocean, which are often lacking for “Indo-Pacific” taxa. We also advance the understanding of phylogenetic patterns in a recent radiation of nudibranchs and highlight patterns of population structure in two widespread congenerics. Future work will incorporate an exon-capture approach for resolving species-level relationships.</string>

Bolstad\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nNew Zealand has one of the highest biodiversities of squid and octopus species reported for any country to date. Although squid are prey to a variety of predators, the dietary habits of most squid species remain unknown. Squid use their sharp beaks to masticate prey, which makes morphological identification difficult (often impossible). The taxonomy of deep-sea squid species, in particular, remains unstable due to the delicate nature of the specimens, which are often badly damaged during capture. Therefore, a genetic analysis is most appropriate to assess the feeding habits, and an integrative taxonomic approach is ideal for their systematics. \nResults\nThe ecology and systematics of several families of deep-sea squids in New Zealand waters have been analysed. Using a combination of traditional taxonomy with genetics (the DNA barcode region of COI and 16S rRNA), more than a dozen new species have been discovered. Effort has been concentrated on families with high local diversity (Onychoteuthidae), particularly unstable systematics (Mastigoteuthidae, Chiroteuthidae, Octopoteuthidae), and high importance in the diets of marine mammals (Histioteuthidae, Ommastrephidae). In addition to clarifying the true local composition of these families, DNA barcoding has also provided useful information on the dietary habits of large, poorly known squid species (Architeuthis, Idioteuthis). \nSignificance\nTaxonomy underpins all biological research. Accurate identifications are vital for species conservation and understanding ecological relationships. Many of the locally occurring deep-sea species are commercially valuable or play an important role in the diet of other economically, ecologically, culturally, and inherently biologically valuable animals including fish, marine mammals, and seabirds. An accurate understanding of New Zealand squid biodiversity is essential in monitoring and managing the local marine environment and resources.</string>
    <string name="id430">Presenting Author: Hotke, Kathryn\n\nContact: khotke@mail.uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Kathryn Hotke\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n Members of the scyphozoan genus Cyanea are a conspicuous element of the marine zooplankton. Despite their large size, broad distribution and abundance, the taxonomy of the genus is uncertain. Many described taxa have been synonymized with C. capillata. Along with weak morphological descriptions, the identification of Cyanea specimens is often complicated by specimen fragility and poorly preserved museum material. Molecular analyses have begun to advance understanding of species boundaries in Cyanea, and also to aid specimen identification. This study examines sequence variation in the barcode region of COI to ascertain the number of Cyanea species in Canadian marine waters. The extent of geographic variation in each species was examined through comparison with lineages of the C. capillata complex from other regions. \nResults\n Sequence analysis revealed five lineages of C. capillata s.l. with differing geographical distributions and showing from 5.9-18.0 percent divergence at COI. Sequence variation was also examined in mitochondrial and nuclear gene regions: 16S and internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2). These regions revealed lower divergences (2.7-10.8 percent for 16S, 1.3-8.3 percent for ITS1, 2.2-11.0 percent for ITS2), but associated with those at COI, strongly suggesting that each clade represents a different species. One lineage shows sequence congruence with C. capillata s.s., while another lineage matches C. tzetlinii, recently described from the White Sea. The other three species are likely to represent named taxa that are currently viewed as synonyms of C. capillata. \nSignificance\n Interest in Scyphozoa has grown due to increased occurrences of jellyfish blooms causing adverse economic and ecological effects. This study demonstrates the efficacy of using COI barcodes for scyphozoan species identification, examination of phylogeographic patterns, as well as to highlight cases of deep intra-specific divergence. This work verifies the need for greater effort in species documentation not only to further understanding of marine biodiversity, but also to aid in conservation.</string>

To enhance our knowledge of this key ecosystem, highly impacted by human activities, and to detect possible temporal trends, surveys of marine mammal strandings were conducted every three months along 390km of the Mauritanian coast. Combining DNA analyses with morphological evidence allowed species identification of even highly incomplete, damaged carcasses, and permitted us to undertake population genetics studies for the harbour porpoise, a vulnerable neritic odontocete. \nResults\n More than 300 samples of carcasses were collected from 2013 till 2015, including 33 non-identified. The DNA barcoding approach, by using cox1 as a genetic marker, allowed us to identify 30 specimens, including rare species, and led to the discovery of a specimen of Balaenoptera omurai, 18,000 km away from its known range, and a first record in the Atlantic Ocean (Jung et al., 2015). Among the 105 samples collected of harbour porpoises, many were highly degraded so extracting DNA remained a challenge. After experimental optimization, 91 individuals (87 percent) were successfully sequenced for part of the mtDNA. Also, 7 microsatellites loci are being analyzed. For more than half of the samples, genetic sexing was achieved, revealing 31 males and 38 females. \nSignificance\n Monitoring of cetacean strandings is essential to evaluate anthropogenic impacts, especially where fisheries efforts and industrial exploitation are high such as along the Mauritanian coast. Surveillance of strandings linked to a barcoding approach is very useful and cost-effective to assess long-term trends in cetacean species composition and to detect unusual mortality events. The discovery of species formerly unknown to occur, such as B. omurai, highlights the remarkable biodiversity of the Canary Current ecosystem and re-emphasizes the importance of systematic beach survey programme.</string>
    <string name="id204">Presenting Author: Locke, Sean\n\nContact: sean.locke@upr.edu\n\nAuthors: Sean Locke, David J. Marcogliese\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIdentification of digeneans (Platyhelminthes: Trematoda) to species is challenging. Morphological differences among congeners are often subtle in these small, soft-bodied organisms. Single species may also display significant morphological variation in different hosts. Digeneans typically infect three different hosts, in which the developmental stages of the parasite are strongly dissimilar. Life cycles can be elucidated with experimental infections, which may also shed light on host-induced morphological variation, but this approach is impractical in biodiversity assessment. DNA barcodes provide an efficient way to link life cycle stages, identify specimens, and discover potentially overlooked species. Herein, results will be presented from barcodes obtained from digeneans in wildlife, with emphasis on the Diplostomoidea. Parasites were collected from more than 120 birds (40 species), 3,000 fish (93 species), and 50 amphibians (7 species) from the Americas (mainly), Europe, Iraq, and China. \nResults\nIn a surprising number of cases, barcodes from adult diplostomoids from definitive hosts were not matched by those of sympatric larval parasites, even in intensely sampled regions. In North America, barcodes connected larval and adult parasites in 15 diplostomoid species, but because of the difficulty of vouchering the taxonomically informative but small adults, the number of positive identifications is smaller. Contrary to long-held views, larval stages in most diplostomoid species are specific to a narrow range of fish or frog hosts. COI distances are correlated with geographic distances, but patterns differ in two widely sampled genera. \nSignificance\nIn an intensely and widely sampled genus, Diplostomum, sampling effort, but not spatial scale of sampling, has a significant but non-problematic effect on metrics related to COI distance-based species delineation. Species richness in Diplostomum is unevenly distributed among larval infection sites, and an ecological mechanism is proposed to explain the apparent difference in speciation rates.</string>

Barta\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nParasites in the protistan phylum Apicomplexa are ubiquitous in metazoan hosts and cosmopolitan in distribution. The complexity of their life cycles (encompassing both asexual and sexual modes of replication), sometimes incorporating multiple hosts (e.g. as seen in malaria or toxoplasmosis) and multiple morphological forms, make identification of these parasites challenging. Early attempts to use sequence data to complement morphology-based parasite identification and phylogenetic analyses focused on nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (i.e. 18S rDNA); unfortunately, at least some apicomplexan parasites possess 2-3 paralogous nuclear rDNA arrays that can be highly divergent. Early work using mitochondrial (mt) sequences focused on the use of cytochrome b (cytb) and, more recently, cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). More widespread use of mt genetic targets was impeded by the huge variation in mt genome structure within the phylum and the associated difficulty of generating useful DNA barcoding PCR primer sets. \nResults\nPCR-based amplifications of mt protein-coding regions and subsequent sequencing (classical DNA barcoding) were developed for a number of groups of apicomplexan parasites. Morphologically indistinguishable adeleorinid parasites (Hepatozoon spp) and eimeriid parasites (Isospora spp) could be differentiated readily using partial mt genome sequences. Cryptic sympatric species could be detected in mixed samples, even in the presence of a large surplus of host DNA. The generation of complete (~6,000 bp) mt genome sequences by amplifying overlapping PCR amplicons confirmed that divergent mt genomes were present in both cases. No evidence of paralogous mt gene copies was detected. \nSignificance\nWidespread adoption of DNA barcoding for rapid identification and genetic analyses of coccidian parasites may now be possible. Traditional taxonomy and morphology will remain an essential source of well-characterized specimens destined for barcoding. As more data become available, barcoding will become increasingly useful as a diagnostic and taxonomic tool; barcode generated sequences will help resolve evolutionary relationships between morphologically similar parasites.</string>

Prosser, Chris Weland, Dave Westcott, Nicholas Johnson, Anthony Fooks\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThirty-four species of mosquitoes are present in the UK, of which nine have been implicated in West Nile virus (WNV) transmission elsewhere. Enzootic arboviruses have not been recorded in the UK, although serological studies in birds have reported virus-specific neutralizing antibodies to arboviruses. The identification of mosquito feeding preferences and species delineation is paramount to the understanding of vector-host-pathogen interactions and would help to predict transmission patterns. This, in turn, would assist in the control of outbreaks. In this paper, we test the utility of DNA barcoding for vertebrate species identification in blood-fed females following Ivanova et al. (2007). We also test bloodmeal DNA extractions to molecularly delineate mosquito species and detect viruses associated with mosquitoes. \nResults\nBlood-fed females (n=134) were collected from sites in southern England and identified as seven morphospecies, of which Anopheles maculipennis and Culex pipiens are species complexes. In total, we positively identified the blood meal in 65 specimens (49 percent - cow, human, dog, European rabbit, great tit, magpie, blackbird, and barn swallow]. Analysis of ITS2 and COI barcoding region sequences in Anopheles maculipennis revealed the presence of two species, An. atroparvus (33 specimens) and An. messae (7 specimens); one sample was misidentified. Thirty three An. atroparvus had fed on European rabbit, of which nine were positive for Myxoma virus. The results from ITS2 and COI revealed that specimens identified as Cx. pipiens/torrentium were Cx. pipiens pipiens. \nSignificance\nThis study demonstrates the application of DNA barcoding for the identification of vertebrate species that mosquitoes have fed on. Moreover, the same sample can be screened for the presence of pathogens, and there is sufficient invertebrate DNA to perform ITS2 and COI DNA barcoding region PCRs to molecularly identify the mosquito species.</string>

To assess viral diversity, though, one first needs to define what viral species are. Viral taxonomy faces important challenges such as the propensity of viruses to recombine and show fast evolutionary rates. Species delimitation criteria in viruses are usually based on genetic divergence and host use. Here we use a phylogenetic clustering approach for species delimitation. We then used a combination of phylogenetic and ecological data to investigate the main ecological factors driving the diversification of baculoviruses (insect-specific large DNA viruses of the family Baculoviridae) that mainly attack the insect order Lepidoptera. \nResults\nWe generated a molecular phylogeny for ~500 viral isolates, using four essential core genes (polh, lef-8, lef-9, pif-2). Among the baculovirus isolates, 88 have complete genomes and were used to reconstruct a robust whole-genome backbone tree for the phylogeny. We used GMYC and PTP methods to delimit without a priori 150 clusters, including 106 new species. This approach recovered all known species and allowed the unification in single taxa of isolates labeled under different names. Comparative analyses revealed high levels of host specificity and phylogenetic conservatism in Baculoviridae. Moreover, the colonization of a new ecological niche (type of plant growth associated with insect host) has in some cases led to baculovirus radiation. \nSignificance\nThe International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses recognizes currently 44 species in the Baculoviridae. Our study shows that a set of four core genes could be used as DNA barcodes for the family Baculoviridae from which we could identify 150 candidate species. This study is the first to use a phylogenetic clustering approach, inspired by DNA barcoding practices in Metazoa, for species delimitation in viruses. Our results show that phylogenetic clustering could be used to unify viral taxonomy.</string>

Many of the species of this family have been sorted into species complexes due to morphological similarities. Molecular tools provided an efficient way to discriminate within species complexes, and in this work we used two different molecular markers (ITS-1, ITS-2, and COI) to identify Contracaecum multipapillatum and relate it with the sibling species of its own complex (e.g. C. multipapillatum A, B, C, or D). Our samples were obtained from brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), both on the Gulf of California and the pacific coast of Baja California Peninsula. \nResults\nSequence comparisons within the two markers suggest the presence of two species due to the relatively high genetic difference computed with F84 similarities (ITS-1 = 13 percent; ITS-2 = 13 percent; COI = 3 percent). To assign our sequences with some of the sibling species, we compared them against GenBank data; only ITS-1 and ITS-2 sequences were available for C. multipapillatum. These comparisons grouped some of our sequences with C. multipapillatum, while other sequences were grouped with C. bioccai. \nSignificance\nThe presence of C. bioccai would be a new record in our study area, and we suggest the possibility that the two species have similar life cycles with an overlap in their definitive host and co-occur in the same distribution because of pelican migrations.</string>

Jambulingam\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcodes (COI) for the three morphologically similar species members of the Culex vishnui subgroup of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae)—Culex vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus—have been described earlier by us. These species are important vectors of Japanese encephalitis in India and other South and East Asian countries. Making use of the genetic variability in their DNA barcode sequences, we propose a simple PCR method towards their species characterization. \nResults\nDNA extracted from 2-3 legs per specimen were subjected to semi-nested PCR involving four DNA primers (one universal forward and three species-specific reverse) designed in silico, based on the COI barcode sequences of the Cx. vishnui subgroup. The reaction yielded about 150, 330, and 590 base pair fragments for Cx. vishnui, Cx. pseudovishnui, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, respectively. \nSignificance\nThis methodology can be performed by resource-limited laboratories involved in routine disease control programs as they do not require sophisticated equipment/facilities for DNA sequencing and bio-informatic analyses. As well, this strategy could be adopted for characterization of morphologically similar species for other taxonomic groups of medically important arthropods.</string>

The aim of the project is to use this mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) reference database to begin using DNA barcodes to identify species from minute samples in the investigation and prosecution of wildlife crimes. This is a national project managed by the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI), working with the South Africa Police Services forensics unit and National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), and sponsored by Google Global Impacts awards through the Smithsonian Institution. \nResults\nTo date, 38 priority species have been identified as well as 98 look-alike species, that comprise all CITES-listed mammals, birds, and reptiles that occur in South Africa. These species have been collected from the wild, game reserves, zoos, and museum collections under chain of custody, with five individuals representing each species. Examples of forensic cases that have been analysed using the BWP COI databases will be discussed including other forensic analyses approaches that are done by the NZG. \nSignificance\nThe significance of the project will be to implement and demonstrate the use of DNA barcoding in the prosecution of wildlife crime to support national conservation efforts for critically endangered wildlife species of South Africa.</string>

Soniya\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAnimal poaching is one of the major threats to animals in wild. It is imperative to punish the offenders to prevent illegal hunting. Samples confiscated by forest officers in Kerala Forest Department are forwarded to our lab for species-level identification, so as to enable them to charge the case and punish the offenders. DNA barcoding helps to identify animals even from minute or cooked samples. The exact identification of species from the Western Ghats region of Kerala, which is one of the hottest among biodiversity hotspots, is often difficult or impossible due to the lack of reference sequences in databases. This is more prominent in the case of endemic species, where most of the times reference data are not available. \nResults\nWe have collected blood/muscle samples from 67 captive animals in Thiruvananthapuram Zoo, India. Samples included endemic and threatened species present in the Western Ghats and local as well as migratory birds. DNA was isolated from the samples, and COI as well as Cytochrome b genes were amplified and sequenced using universal primers. The present study generated sequences of 16 mammal, 8 reptile, and 36 bird species, of which 9 species were previously unrepresented in NCBI-GenBank or BOLD. The newly generated sequences have been deposited in BOLD under the project WFDB. \nSignificance\nSpecies identification using DNA barcoding has become an integral part of wildlife forensics, providing evidence to the legal bodies to punish the offenders in poaching cases and thus aiding in the conservation of endangered and endemic animals. An authentic DNA barcode reference database is a pre-requisite for enabling the correct identification of species. The present study to develop a DNA barcode reference database of the captive animals in the Thiruvananthapuram Zoo, Kerala, India is an initiative in this regard, which will augment future wildlife investigations.</string>

Species at risk face immediate danger and warrant fast attention if they are not to be lost. The Redside Dace, Clinostomus elongatus (Teleostei: Cyprinidae), is a small North American minnow that is declining throughout its range as a result of urban development. Fin clips and buccal swabs were obtained from 28 Redside Dace populations throughout Ontario and the United States for sequence analysis. As Redside Dace exhibit very little variation in COI, other mitochondrial genes (Cytochrome b and ATPase 6+8) were sequenced to investigate phylogeographic structuring among extant populations. The populations were also genotyped using 10 microsatellite loci to examine genetic diversity as well as contemporary spatial structuring. \nResults\nThe combined sequencing and genotyping results indicate that Redside Dace persisted in multiple glacial refugia during the Wisconsinan glaciation and exhibit significant geographic structure, as well as retaining high genetic diversity within declining populations. \nSignificance\nThese results will be used to inform management decisions for Redside Dace recovery in Ontario and other parts of the species range.</string>

To ensure compliance with legal statutes, forensic identification approaches relying on molecular markers may be used to identify the species of origin of animal material including hairs, claw, blood, bone, or meat. Using this approach, DNA sequences from the COI ‘‘barcoding’’ gene have been used to identify material from a number of domesticated animal species. However, many wild species of carnivores still present great challenges in generating COI barcodes using standard ‘‘universal’’ primer pairs. \nResults\n In the work presented here, the mitochondrial COI gene was successfully amplified using a novel primer cocktail, and the products were sequenced to determine the species of twenty one unknown samples of claw material collected as part of forensic wildlife case investigations. Sixteen of the unknown samples were recognized to have originated from either Panthera leo or P. pardus individuals. The remaining five samples could be identified only to the family level due to the absence of reference animal sequences. \nSignificance\n This is the first report on the use of COI sequences for the identification of P. pardus and P. leo from claw samples as part of forensic investigations in India. The study also highlights the need for adequate reference material to aid in the resolution of suspected cases of illegal wildlife harvesting.</string>

We addressed three questions: 1. Can we use barcodes to identify Brassicogethes pollen beetles? 2. Is the taxonomy of the genus supported by clustering patterns in the barcode data? 3. Can barcodes provide within-species indications of geographic origins? \nResults\nOur beetle specimens were largely in a clade containing GenBank-identified specimens of B. aeneus, with the second commonest species being B. viridescens. Other individuals were placed in more divergent lineages that in some cases could be matched with GenBank-identified specimens of Brassicogethes species, but in other cases did not match closely enough (< 95 percent BLAST sequence similarity) to any identified specimen. 2. Individuals identified as species thought to be host plant-specific were found on a wide range of plant species. Adults of B. aeneus and B. viridescens are associated with a range of plant taxa outside the Brassicaceae, to the extent that we found no partitioning of Meligethes sensu lato sequences by plant family using AMOVA. 3. The barcodes suggest a north-south divide of B. aeneus in the UK, a pattern also observed with extended sampling across Europe. Northern UK B. aeneus populations included individuals from haplotype clades of northern Europe, whereas those from the southern UK have haplotypes that cluster with central and southern Europe. A similar pattern was observed for B. viridescens. \nSignificance\nThere is apparently a good deal more species-level diversity in this group than was either previously recognized or previously included in DNA barcoding surveys. 2. Barcode data combined with host plant data provide an alternative, perhaps more reliable, view of the taxonomy and ecology of this group. 3. An assessment of spatial structure within MOTUs/species, and its implications for delimiting species with barcodes, would benefit from more extensive sampling.]]></string>

Saritha, Vikram Khilare Vasantrao, Gulab Khedkar\n\nAbstract:\nOrnamental plants are appreciated globally for their beautiful appearance, shape, and colors. The expanded use of these plants has caused their cash value to rival and in some instances exceed the value of food and fibre crops. Considering the morphological forms, species, subspecies, and hybrids of ornamental plants, monitoring programmes are largely inadequate at quarantine stations and border inspection points. Besides, ornamental plant trading not only includes the plantlets but also includes seeds, twigs, shoots, tubers, leaves, flowers, canes/stems, cuttings, or tissue cultures, etc., for which the traditional approach to identifying specimens through morphological examination is challenging or impossible even for experts. The diverse biogeographical and environmental conditions in India may affect phenotypic plasticity of ornamental plant species. Therefore, we have conducted a detailed survey of ornamental plants in India through DNA barcoding. Altogether, we have barcoded 690 ornamental plant specimens belonging to 290 species. We tested the utility of three barcode regions, ITS2, rbcL, and matK, for species identification. There are almost 30 ornamental plant species are under global trade. For the selected species included here, the data generated will certainly help in conservation and in understanding both species boundaries and geographical variation in ornamental plant species from India. The reference barcode library we have created will serve to open the access to genetic data for effective management and conservation of this important resource, supporting India’s Biological Diversity Act 2006.</string>

Sometimes this variation is highly clustered so that a species shows a deep intraspecific split in mtDNA with no intermediates. While building a complete reference library for ~2,600 species of Finnish Lepidoptera, dozens of such deep splits were detected. In order to investigate the presence of cryptic species, we sequenced six taxonomically informative nuclear genes (EF-1a, MDH, CAF, IDH, RpS5, and wingless) in 29 lepidopteran species, each having a deep (>2 percent) sympatric intraspecific split in the DNA barcode region. \nResults\nThe results suggest that some, but only a minority of splits, are due to the presence of a previously undetected morphologically cryptic species. Some cases may be attributed to historical polymorphism. Several splits have likely resulted from introgression, i.e. transfer of the mitochondrial genome from one species to another. Wolbachia infection was detected in many cases, and some splits may be explained by Wolbachia-driven spread of alien mitochondrial haplotypes in the population after an introgression event. \nSignificance\nOverall, our results suggest that DNA barcodes have great potential in revealing new species even among well-investigated groups and areas. We also show that other biological processes may result in mitochondrial polymorphisms that may occasionally impede the usefulness of DNA barcodes in species identification.]]></string>

Pie, André Victor Lucci\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSurveys of insect diversity, especially in the tropics, are strongly impeded by the difficulty in obtaining accurate species delimitation and identification. DNA barcoding proved an efficient method to enhance species diversity assessment in Lepidoptera, permitting reliable species identification and frequently unveiling overlooked or cryptic diversity. In this study, 14,026 individuals of Tiger-Moths (Erebidae: Arctiinae) were sampled over 2 years along an elevational gradient in a large fragment of the endangered Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. \nResults\nAfter an initial sorting of 294 species based on external morphology and color patterns, we successfully sequenced DNA barcodes for 1,100 specimens representing 291 of these species. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined using a 2 percent sequence divergence threshold and compared to morphospecies defined from our initial morphological assessment (IMA). Because species delimitation based on wing patterns is known to potentially overlook closely resembling “cryptic” species, we also carried out a morphological reassessment (MRA) of species diversity based on the comparison of male genital structure to further investigate cases where IMA species and DNA barcode OTUs were incongruent. From a total of 291 IMA species, 201 matched their respective OTUs. Morphology could not be reassessed in three species, and the species delimitations changed in the remaining 87 IMA species, suggesting that as much as 30 percent of the diversity might be overlooked when using superficial morphological comparison. Interestingly, a close examination of the male genital morphology revealed that only 14 IMA species did not match barcode OTUs. All the results reported here, including the several cases of cryptic species and sexual dimorphism found among the 87 IMA species that did not match Barcode OTUs, are available on BOLD under the name of Lepidoptera of Serra do Mar Project. \nSignificance\nIn addition to being useful for further taxonomic studies, the data available in the Lepidoptera of Serra do Mar Project allow automated species identifications of a considerable part of the arctiines in the Atlantic Forest and thus is a valuable tool for conservation purposes.</string>

Around 850 named species in 10 genera form part of an unknown but much larger global diversity. The group offers insights into evolution between insects and host plants. Traditional methods to investigate their diversity and host plant relations require considerable human effort, an impediment further confounded by their extremely small body size (3-8 mm). DNA barcodes can speed up recognition of host plant relations, distribution, and taxonomy. \nResults\nWe built a barcode dataset of leaf-mining larvae and emerging adults from focused sampling in many parts of the world, study of museum specimens, and barcoding initiatives such as in Finland (www.finbol.org). We mined the Barcode of Life Datasystems (BOLD) for all barcoded specimens labeled with the family name, and additionally searched for closely-allied Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) lacking family-level taxonomy. We found almost 5,500 barcoded specimens, representing 928 BINs and ca 890 species, of which more than 55 percent are unnamed or unidentified. A large portion of the specimens (around 2,500) originated from the massive malaise trapping program at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario. Most were initially identified only to the ordinal or family level. We use our data for estimating the unknown biodiversity of Nepticulidae, globally and per continent. For North America alone, our results suggest 40 unnamed species, confirm 12 species as Holarctic (including several newly recorded), and link previously unidentified host records to named adults. \nSignificance\nBarcoding mass-trapped specimens showed an unprecedented increase in our knowledge of distribution, host plant use, and invasiveness in an intractable and otherwise poorly known group. Such records, however, acquire scientific value only if validated by a solid barcode reference library that has been vetted by taxonomic expertise. We advocate combining large-scale biodiversity inventories with DNA barcoding.</string>

N. Hebert\n\nAbstract\nBackground\nIslands possess varied histories and geographical and ecological settings, and they are exposed to different stochastic events. Because of this complexity, the mechanisms determining and maintaining species assemblages on islands are poorly understood, and analyses of entire taxonomic groups of sufficiently large areas are necessary to disentangle the array of factors that determine the composition and genetic attributes of island communities. We use comparative analyses linking community and phylogenetic approaches for the butterfly fauna of the circum-Sicilian islands, a key intercontinental region in the western Mediterranean, to understand the factors that shaped the observed assemblages and to highlight populations of exceptional conservation value. \nResults\nSpecies richness was mainly influenced by contemporary factors, but Pleistocene connections also had a significant impact. A nested pattern was detected when all species were considered, but this pattern disappeared when they were divided into “widespread” and “uncommon” taxa. The frequency of a species on the mainland was a weak predictor of its frequency on islands, and most residuals appeared related to migratory or sedentary behavior. DNA barcoding of more than 80 percent of the butterfly species recorded in the region revealed that Europe and north Africa formed two well-differentiated genetic groups and that islands showed a high similarity with the mainland they were formerly connected to during Pleistocene low sea levels. Genetically diversified lineages were most frequent in “uncommon” species, while “widespread” species were genetically homogeneous. \nSignificance\nThis study used an unprecedented integrative approach to examine the biogeography of an entire superfamily in a complex biogeographical contact zone. For the first time, it was possible to recognize the processes responsible for the observed species assemblages and to highlight the uniqueness of each island community. These patterns also revealed the value of assessing morphospecies coupled with information on intraspecific genetic diversity to obtain the information needed for accurate conservation decisions.</string>

Because incomplete taxonomic coverage can confound macroevolutionary inferences, taxon sampling must be representative and balanced. The nearly complete DNA barcode libraries assembled in diverse insect groups (e.g. Lepidoptera) provide refined accounts of species boundaries and greatly facilitate sampling design for phylogenetic studies interested in relatively recent (up to 20-30 MY) diversification events. Here, we use RAD-seq to infer phylogenetic relationships in comet and moon moths (Saturniidae) and to investigate their diversification in space and time, also taking into account a set of adaptive traits (hostplants, wing morphology). \nResults\nStarting from a comprehensive DNA barcode library, we selected 48 individuals representing 41 species in the genera Actias, Argema, and Graellsia, plus 7 outgroups. We generated a RAD library using genomic DNA extracted from individuals representing contrasted preservation conditions and also using DNA extracts previously obtained from specimen collections for DNA barcoding. Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) was carried out when initial DNA quantities were too small. The RAD library is used to produce a robust and fully resolved phylogenetic hypothesis for these moths, and their relationships are discussed in the light of species distributions and life-history traits (e.g. pine-feeding species, length of hindwing tails). \nSignificance\nOur results concur with those from a growing number of recent studies demonstrating the power of RAD sequencing to infer interspecific phylogenetic relationships with a high degree of robustness. Here, our results allowed the investigation of diversification history in an emblematic group of Lepidoptera. Our approach also highlights the usefulness of DNA barcode libraries to guide sample selection in groups incompletely resolved taxonomically. The potential use of DNA banks generated during the course of DNA barcoding campaigns is discussed, as well as the recourse to WGA when the quantity of DNA is limited.</string>
    <string name="id382">Presenting Author: Kekkonen, Mari\n\nContact: kekkonen@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Mari Kekkonen\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAlthough the identification of species has been the main goal of DNA barcoding, the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system together with other algorithmic approaches have enhanced the use of barcodes for species discovery and delineation. These tools are extremely helpful for the evaluation of global patterns of species diversity, but they can lack taxonomic context. Currently, many BINs (i.e. putative species), especially from poorly sampled taxonomic groups and geographic regions, cannot be placed to a correct higher taxon because there is no closely related species on BOLD. As much biological insight can be gained from placement within the Linnean hierarchy, there is a need to see if barcodes contain enough phylogenetic signal to permit such assignments. \nResults\nSeveral efforts are underway to construct a functional identification system for higher taxonomic levels based on the analysis of DNA barcode data. The present study tests the cohesiveness of various insect families. Preliminary results suggest that DNA barcodes possess enough phylogenetic signal to enable family-level assignments, but there is much variation in the difficulty of this task among and even within orders. The lepidopteran superfamily Gelechioidea, a particularly challenging group, is considered as a case study. \nSignificance\nFamily-level assignments for species recognized through DNA barcoding have traditionally been based on morphological characters. However, many studies employing next-generation sequencing cannot use this approach because the link between specimens and sequences is absent. Morphological determinations can be difficult or impossible for many other reasons (e.g. no taxonomic expert is available, the voucher is in poor condition, or diagnostic characters for family identifications are homoplastic), leaving DNA-based assignments as the only option. Due to the steeply increasing number of studies where morphological approaches cannot be employed, a reliable identification tool for the family level would be a major aid to large-scale biodiversity assessments.</string>

Young, Kareina d’Souza, Annegret Nicolai\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe phylum Mollusca is a diverse animal group that is poorly studied although many species are problematic in two opposite ways. Some species are successful colonizers that might become invaders, whereas other species suffer from environmental changes and might become endangered. We have begun the construction of a DNA barcode reference library for Canada’s native and introduced terrestrial gastropods. Using the invasive snail Cepaea nemoralis, we also tested the reliability of the non-invasive method of visceral swabs from live specimens for obtaining barcodes. \nResults\nBarcode records for more than half of Canada’s native and introduced terrestrial gastropod species have been compiled. A new introduced slug species has been discovered in New Brunswick: Arion flagellus, and the distribution of some native gastropod has been revised (e.g. two rare slug species of the genera Philomycus are sympatric on Pelee Island, ON). Thanks to wide-ranging sampling of C. nemoralis, extending to both eastern and western provinces in Canada as well as its native range in Europe, this work has identified three separate introductions. Two of these introductions originate from widespread lineages in Europe, with a third introduction from a rare lineage with a restricted range in Scotland and Poland. \nSignificance\nA DNA barcode reference library for Canadian terrestrial gastropods is an essential platform for future work, particularly for the detection of cryptic ground-dwelling species from soil samples using environmental DNA. Our study also highlights the use of unconventional methods for DNA barcoding. The visceral swab protocol for terrestrial gastropods has been optimized, allowing for easier inter-continental shipping of DNA material. This method has been successfully applied to identify unique C. nemoralis lineages in Canada and to uncover three separate invasions from Europe. Furthermore, using such non-invasive protocols offer new possibilities of studying gastropod distribution or the genetic structure of species at risk. As such, this work has advanced our understanding of terrestrial mollusc biodiversity in Canada.</string>

The recent invasions by a number of suckermouth sailfin catfish species from the genus Pterygoplichthys in India is a matter of concern, especially considering the fast pace of invasion coupled with the ecological consequences to indigenous species. Fishes of the genus Pterygoplichthys can be identified by key taxonomic characters such as the presence of 9 or more (usually 10) dorsal fin rays, supraoccipital bone bordered posteriorly by one large plate, and the absence of an elevated supraoccipital process. Native to the streams, floodplain lakes, and marshes of South America, Pterygoplichthys spp. have invaded inland water bodies of various countries around the world through the uncontrolled pet trade, resulting in serious ecological and economic consequences. Partial sequences of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome b (cyt b), and ribosomal 16S ribosomal RNA were prepared from tissue samples of invasive Pterygoplichthys spp. from various states of India. \nResults\nSpecies-level match queries for our Pterygoplichthys COI sequences in GenBank recorded 100 percent genetic similarity with four species; namely, P. ambrosettii, P. pardalis, P. disjunctivus, and P. joselimaianus). Sequences of cyt b were 99-100 percent similar to those of Hypostomus plecostomus, P. disjunctivus, and P. pardalis. Finally, 16S rRNA showed 98-98 percent sequence similarity with P. ambrosettii and H. cochliodon. The haplotypes demonstrated low genetic variation, and the overlapping morphological characters of the specimens examined indicated possible hybrids of Pterygoplichthys and that accidental introductions of the hybrids into natural water bodies through the aquarium trade might have brought about the sympatry. \nSignificance\nThe present study discusses the need for molecular markers to delineate hybrids and barcoding of topotypes to establish the identity of invasive sailfin catfish in India.</string>

Water soldier (Stratiotes aloides) is an invasive aquatic plant with a single wild population in North America (Trent River, Ontario) that has the potential to spread rapidly through dispersed vegetative fragments. Once established, water soldier may become an extremely deleterious invasive species because it forms dense mats of floating vegetation that crowd out native species, has the potential to alter water chemistry, and can hinder aquatic recreational activities. Although it is now too late to prevent its establishment, the distribution of water soldier remains limited, and swift action following early detection via environmental DNA (eDNA) markers could minimize its spread. \nResults\nIn this study, we first screened three regions of chloroplast DNA (matK, rbcL, and trnH-psbA) as potential eDNA markers using ten different species of aquatic plants, and found that matK was the region most likely to harbour appropriate levels of intra- and inter-specific variability appropriate for designing species-specific markers. We designed markers for all ten species and further tested the water soldier markers on eDNA extracted from water samples by using an experimental approach to quantify the limits of detection based on plant biomass. We are now using these markers to screen water samples from sites of known and suspected water soldier occupancy in order to infer presence or absence. \nSignificance\nAlthough eDNA detection has some limitations, our study has shown that eDNA markers have potentially important applications for the early detection of invasive aquatic plants. This method of detection can be used to complement physical search methods, or it can be used independently when environmental barriers inhibit physical monitoring. In conclusion, eDNA detection is a promising tool that warrants further investigation.</string>
    <string name="id111">Presenting Author: YUE, Qiaoyun\n\nContact: 779721036@qq.com\n\nAuthors: Qiaoyun YUE, Charles C.COOK, Deyi Qiu, Jia Hu, Jian Chen\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe blowfly Chrysomya megacephala (Fabricius), or oriental latrine fly, is the most common human-associated fly in South, Southeast, and Eastern Asia. C. megacephala larvae develop in feces and decomposing flesh and, though native to Eurasia, have spread through human activity around the world. C. megacephala larvae are used in wound therapy and for forensic entomology. Dried larvae are also used as animal feed and in traditional Chinese medicine, while adults may vector bacterial pathogens. We used cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcodes to survey variation in C. megacephala related blowflies, and other flies in China, and to assess the utility of barcodes to identify the morphologically cryptic larvae of these species. \nResults\nWe collected C. megaphala, its congener C. pinguis, and 12 other species from 42 locations in China as well as in Manila and Lima. In addition to the two chyrosomids, these included flies from five other species in the family Calliphoridae, three from the Muscidae, and three from the Sarcophagidae. We successfully sequenced the 658 bp COI barcoding region from 645 individuals, including 208 C. megacephala and 36 C. pinguis. Kimura-2-parameter distance plots distinguish C. megacephala from C. pinguis and all other fly species. Additionally, there is no indication of geographic variation in C. megacephala within China. \nSignificance\nThe larvae of C. megacaphala are important in forensic death investigations, in wound therapy, and in traditional Chinese medicine, yet can be difficult to identify. Our work shows that the standard COI barcode can quickly distinguish C. megacepahala from other flies in China, including C. pinguis, its closest congener. This confirms previous work on this species from other locations. We are currently comparing our sequences from Chinese flies with all other reported C. megacephala barcodes (152 sequences from BOLD) to assess worldwide geographical variation and will report these results as well.</string>

The complete mitochondrial genome of the pink stem borer has been sequenced in China; however, few reports on the COI gene sequences are available in GenBank. This study reports on the genetic variations in Sesamia inferens population from rice, collected from 18 different locations of Punjab, India. The DNA barcode region (COI) was amplified using specific primers and the PCR product was cloned. The nucleotide sequences were determined through custom service of Xcelris Pvt Ltd, Ahmedabad. \nResults\nThe sequences obtained were blasted in NCBI, and all the samples showed 99 per cent similarity with Sesamia inferens. Multiple alignment of all sequences revealed substitutive variation at 22 different nucleotide positions that were distributed in the 658bp sequence of COI gene obtained. A phylogenetic tree was obtained using the maximum likelihood method in MEGA6, which established a maximum genetic divergence of 1.57 percent among Punjab populations. A low level of genetic difference was reported in populations collected from the same district viz. Faridkot, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Barnala. Comparative analysis of the COI gene sequences of the populations analyzed in this study with the sequences retrieved for S. inferens from China and Korea established that the pink stem borer populations from Punjab are genetically distinct from those of Korea and China, with genetic variation ranging from 4.4 to 6.56 per cent. \nSignificance\nGenetic variations in Sesamia inferens populations in Punjab, China, and Korea were reported in the present study. It established that this pest occurs in nature as many distinct genotypes. Therefore, there is need to continuously monitor the populations of Sesamia inferens throughout the world so that appropriate pest management strategies are developed and employed for effective control of this pest.</string>

A., Deepu Mathew, Haseena Bhaskar\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIdentification of spider mite species is an important issue in pest control as members of this group are responsible for significant crop losses. The use of DNA barcodes, short DNA sequences from a standardized region of the genome, has recently been proposed as a tool to facilitate species identification and discovery. \nResult\nDNA sequence data of economically important Tetranychidae mites were studied: Tetranychus truncatus, T. macfarlanei, and T. okinawanus (reported for the first time in India). These mites were collected from different vegetable crops including cowpea, amaranthus, okra, dolichos bean, brinjal, cucumber, and ridge gourd from various locations in Kerala, India. Spider mites were reared in the laboratory to obtain an isoline from which DNA was isolated separately. Microscopic slides were also prepared for morphological identification. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) of the ribosomal DNA and the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) locus of the mitochondrial genome. ITS2 and COI yielded approximately 620bp and 868bp fragments, respectively. The fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sequences were submitted to GenBank, and sequences showed high similarity with other members of the above-mentioned species within the database. The specimen data, specimen images, sequence information, and trace files were further deposited in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD). Genetic distances were summarized, using the Kimura 2-parameter distance model. Intraspecific COI sequence divergences (T. truncatus and T. okinawanus) were 0 percent to 0.54 percent, while intraspecific divergences within this genus ranged from 9.14 percent to 9.89 percent. ITS2 sequence divergence (T. truncatus, T. okinawanus, T. macfarlanei) within species was 0 percent but 7.7 percent to 7.92 percent within the genus. \nSignificance\nOur work has revealed that both ITS2 and COI are effective markers to differentiate Tetranychus spp. DNA barcoding helps in precise identification of species which can be further used as a diagnostic tool for quarantine as well as in pest management activities.</string>

Ironically, however, basic taxonomic studies in the country are severely lacking. Moreover, the Philippines is also considered as one of the hotspots in terms of fisheries and marine conservation due to numerous threats. For example, despite having a number of aquatic species being regulated in the country, illegal trade still persists through the transport of live and processed products. Fry or juvenile fisheries that potentially contribute to growth overfishing are existent because they are an important source of food and livelihood, especially by artisanal fishermen. Here, our studies revealed new records of a number of marine species. We reported the presence of the recently resurrected beaked whale, Mesoplodon hotaula; a recently resurrected giant clam, Tridacna noae; the reef manta ray, Manta alfredi; and the mobula ray, Mobula japonica. We even discovered the presence of two possible invasive species, the tilapia flowerhorn Cichlasoma urophthalmus and the black chin tilapia Sarotherodon melanotheron in Manila Bay. In terms of trade-related studies, we identified confiscated juvenile eels (elvers) at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and confiscated dried products of sharks and rays at the North Harbor in Manila, and we showed mislabelling in various fishery products sold in major supermarkets in Manila. Finally, we elucidated the following fry (juvenile) fisheries for fisheries management: the siganid “padas” fishery in Northern Luzon; the goby fry “ipon” and Anguilla eel “elvers” fisheries in Aparri, Cagayan; the “dulong” fry fishery in Verde Island Passage, Batangas; and the milkfish “bangus” fry fisheries and its bycatch. Taken together, our studies highlighted DNA barcoding as a powerful tool in addressing some of the major taxonomic and socio-economic issues in Philippine fisheries management and marine biodiversity conservation.</string>

While DNA sequencing holds great promise for species authentication monitoring, such methods must be backed up by robust reference DNA sequence databases and statistically-sound sample collection protocols to track changes in trading practices. This presentation will describe our five-year research effort in South Africa to systematically harness the power of DNA barcoding to detect, monitor, and deter fish mislabeling in the country. \nResults\nBased on rigorous surveys of fish species occurrence on the South African market, reference specimens from 53 commonly available species were collected and expertly identified. A comprehensive DNA sequence library was thereafter established from the reference specimens based on the sequencing of three mitochondrial gene regions (COI, 16S, and 12S rRNA genes). COI barcoding was capable of unequivocally identifying the species origin of the vast majority (98 percent) of fish examined, whereas discrimination of congeneric species was frequently problematic with 16S and 12S rRNA gene sequencing. Subsequent local market surveys employing COI barcoding revealed that 53 of 248 (21 percent) collected fish samples were incorrectly described in terms of species, including 43 of 140 (31 percent) from retailers and 10 of 108 (9 percent) from seafood wholesalers. A recent follow-up study on fish mislabeling in the country demonstrated some minor improvements, with 27 of 149 (18 percent) samples collected from restaurants and retailers being potentially mislabeled. \nSignificance\nDNA barcoding has been confirmed as an extremely powerful method for the identification of fish species traded in South Africa, the utility of which has been strengthened by the generation of reference DNA sequence data for commonly marketed species. Such an approach, when underpinned by structured and on-going seafood testing protocols, can provide an effective and economical tool for industry self-regulation, governmental monitoring, and prosecution of illegal activities.</string>

Warner, Walker Timme, Beth Lowell, Michael Hirshfield, Robert Hanner\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nOceana, an international ocean conservation organization, launched a campaign in 2011 to expose the problem of seafood fraud and to advocate for full supply chain traceability, legal sourcing, and better consumer labeling for all seafood sold in the United States. As part of this campaign, Oceana collected over 1200 seafood samples from 674 grocery stores and restaurants in 14 metropolitan areas in the U.S. from 2010-2012 to determine if they were properly labeled according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines. Most (95 percent) of the sample species identities were determined by the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding and the remainder by other genetic methods. \nResults\nOne third (410/1215) of the samples were mislabeled, revealing a wide range of species substitutions in 27 out of the 46 fish types collected. Species substitutions included those of lesser economic value and those posing health and conservation risks. The fraction of fish mislabeled varied according to the type of fish collected and type of retail outlet where fish samples were purchased. \nSignificance\nWide dissemination of survey findings helped raise awareness of the pervasive problem of seafood fraud nationally and globally. Oceana’s continued advocacy has contributed to advancing policy directives in the U.S., including increased seafood documentation requirements, traceability, and other measures.</string>
    <string name="id52">Presenting Author: Kaeppel, Christine\n\nContact: ChristineKaeppel@eurofins.com\n\nAuthor: Christine Kaeppel, Ilka Haase, Elmar Schilling, Christiana Cicicopol-Boicu, Daniel Richter, Lukas Windhager, Katrin Juling, Birgit Ottenwaelder, Rainer Schubbert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIdentifying animal and microbial species in food and feed has become popular in recent years. Especially since the horse meat scandal in 2013, authenticity tests and safety controls are necessary. The current state of the art is species identification by Sanger Sequencing of several DNA barcode regions. Nevertheless, Sanger Sequencing is limited by the overlay of several sequences in complex samples. Furthermore, species-specific real-time PCRs allow determining only the ingredients that have been searched for and, thus, cannot be applied to samples of unknown content. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) might be able to overcome these challenges and allows analysis of animal and microbial composition in parallel. \nResults\nWe have performed deep amplicon sequencing for mammals, birds, fishes, and molluscs in mixed samples of known content using the Illumina MiSeq technology. Real samples like fish meal were also included in this trial. All NGS data were compared to the results of species-specific real-time PCRs. Furthermore, we have analysed bacterial composition of reference and real samples using the Illumina MiSeq technology, combined with several bioinformatical pipelines. Our results have shown that the Illumina MiSeq technology allows detection of animal and microbial species in complex samples, while the results are in accordance with real-time PCR results. The use of different bioinformatical pipelines has demonstrated that the results’ quality is dependent on the PCR target used and database applied. Furthermore, it has been shown that 16s copy number correction should be applied when analyzing the bacterial content of a sample. \nSignificance\nOur experiments have shown that NGS is able to overcome the drawbacks of Sanger Sequencing and real-time PCR in complex animal and microbial samples. Constantly declining costs for NGS and the ability to analyse animal and microbial components in parallel make the method attractive for routine analyses.</string>

Naaum, Jason St. Jacques, Kimberly Warner, Linda Santschi, Ralph Imondi, Robert Hanner\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding has been applied as a method to test seafood authenticity in numerous market surveys. This trend is continuing to gain momentum as DNA barcoding is employed as a regulatory tool, by the media, and by students to test seafood products, in addition to its use by scientific researchers to monitor seafood substitution. However, as market surveys documenting mislabeling continue to be published by both the press and scientific journals, there is a need for standardization in practices to aid in comparing and verifying research. \nResults\nDeveloped in collaboration with researchers from academia, education, and NGOs, the best practices for conducting and reporting DNA barcoding market studies for seafood identification have been documented for use by citizen scientists, media outlets, and academic researchers. \nSignificance\nThis represents a means for standardizing future DNA barcoding market surveys to allow for better cohesion between studies, and improve the chances for regulatory uptake of this technology. These standards can also be used as a guideline for other methods for conducting market surveys, or for market surveys employing DNA barcoding of other groups of organisms.</string>

However, little is known about how well this method represents the flora. We used the g and h universal plant primers for the short and variable P6 loop region of the chloroplast trnL (UAA) intron to amplify DNA in lake sediment samples of different ages (modern, 100-200 years, and Holocene), as well as modern soil samples. We compare this with modern vegetation and other proxies (pollen and macrofossils) to evaluate the representation of different taxonomical groups, the geographical area likely to be represented, and the taphonomy of DNA. \nResults\nAnalyses of soil samples from the Arctic showed that all species represented in the soil DNA grew within 3 m from the sampling point, most of them within 0.5 m. Lake sediments represent the flora of the catchment area, but a lower proportion of the flora were represented in the DNA record compared to soil samples. DNA and pollen of 100-200 year old lake sediments from regions where forest was planted in the mid-twentieth century showed that both proxies discern major vegetation change at the time of plantation, with similar quantitative changes. In a lake core from the Arctic dated to 8500-1200 cal. BP, all except two genera identified as macrofossils were also identified with DNA. Furthermore, DNA identified six additional taxa and more species per sample. With one DNA extraction and one PCR per sample, we detect most common species independent of sample type or age. Increasing the number of extractions or PCR repeats increased the chances of detecting rare species. Some taxonomic groups (e.g., Cyperaceae) were consistently underestimated whereas other (e.g., water plants) were overrepresented compared to the other proxies. \nSignificance\nThe local flora was well represented in the DNA of the sediments, and the method may have a higher and/or complementary taxonomic resolution than analyses of pollen or macrofossils.</string>
    <string name="id196">Presenting Author: Fahner, Nicole\n\nContact: nfahner@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Nicole Fahner, Donald Baird, Mehrdad Hajibabaei\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSoil captures a comprehensive picture of local plant diversity because it contains seeds, pollen, active and dormant tissues, as well as plant detritus. These sources of environmental DNA (eDNA) can be extracted from soil samples and identified using DNA barcoding in conjunction with next-generation sequencing (NGS) to assess plant diversity. This approach differs from conventional aboveground plant surveys, which are limited to a snapshot of concurrently growing species. Due to potential accumulation of plant tissues over time, however, it is uncertain whether below-ground plant diversity is unchanging year-to-year or if it exhibits interannual turnover. Additionally, DNA markers commonly used for plant identification may differ in their ability to detect interannual changes, and some may be less suitable for DNA metabarcoding of eDNA due to trade-offs between fragment size, taxonomic resolution, and degradation of eDNA. To test this, soil cores were collected over three years from Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta through the Biomonitoring 2.0 project (www.biomonitoring2.org), and four plant marker regions (rbcL, matK, trnL intron P6 loop, and ITS2) were sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq. \nResults\nBelow-ground plant diversity is temporally dynamic. Interannual variability in richness and composition is consistent in magnitude with previously observed above-ground variability at the sites. The number of taxa observed and the temporal variability in richness—but not composition—depend on DNA marker sequence length and sequence diversity. Below-ground richness exceeds past estimates of above-ground richness at the sites only when multiple markers are combined, suggesting a multiple marker approach is necessary. \nSignificance\nBy demonstrating interannual variability in below-ground plant diversity, this research alleviates concerns that accumulations of so-called “zombie” DNA from long-dead organisms will confound eDNA-based biodiversity assessments, thus helping to validate the approach. As well, we show how DNA marker traits can influence biodiversity assessments.</string>
    <string name="id212">Presenting Author: Furlan, Elise\n\nContact: elise.furlan@canberra.edu.au\n\nAuthors: Elise Furlan, Dianne Gleeson, Chris Hardy, Richard Duncan\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly being used as a survey tool to infer species distributions, yet the sensitivity of the technique has not been carefully evaluated. Imperfect sensitivity, or imperfect detection, is a feature of all survey methods and needs to be accounted for in interpreting survey results. We will present a framework to estimate the sensitivity of both the field and laboratory components of an eDNA survey method and show how these can be combined to estimate the overall sensitivity. We will apply this framework to species-specific eDNA surveys to estimate the sensitivity—or probability of detection—for three invasive aquatic species present in Australia: Perca fluviatilis, Cyprinus carpio, and Misgurnus anguillicaudatus. \nResults\nThe eDNA survey successfully detected all three invasive species in environments where they were known to be present, but detection sensitivities differed greatly with season, with greater detection sensitivity typically achieved in spring compared to autumn. These sensitivity estimates can be used to explore different field survey designs to achieve the desired detection sensitivity. This can be done by varying the number of water samples and number of PCR replicates per sample. \nSignificance\nTo utilise eDNA as a management tool, the sensitivity of eDNA detection surveys must be estimated and accounted for. The framework presented here allows researchers to quantify the overall sensitivity of a particular eDNA survey method and to optimise sampling regimes to improve detection sensitivities. This has the potential to improve knowledge of species’ distributions to assist management of both endangered and invasive taxa.</string>
    <string name="id230">Presenting Author: Speksnijder, Arjen\n\nContact: arjen.speksnijder@naturalis.nl\n\nAuthors: Arjen Speksnijder, Kevin Beentjes, Elza Duijm, Youri Lammers, Berry van der Hoorn\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Waterscan project in The Netherlands aims to assess freshwater macrofauna biodiversity by cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) for water quality analysis. The Dutch DNA barcoding database—which includes indicator invertebrates described in the EU water framework directive—combined with the extensive Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database provide the validated reference that is essential for reliable molecular identification. We want to validate next-generation sequencing (NGS) eDNA analysis with COI amplicons from defined complex macrofauna samples compared to traditional morphological analysis. Therefore, we have assessed different lengths for the COI barcode region, ranging from 124bp to the full 658bp, on defined macrofauna samples. Furthermore, we assessed different parameters and databases in the bioinformatics pipeline. \nResults\nOptimal results were obtained using the full COI barcode, where we retrieved most species from defined complex macrofauna samples. Using the full barcode region required some additional work. Amplicons needed to be fragmented and labeled for IonTorrent analysis, but this led to a dataset that contained 95 percent of the expected species. It also included a variety of other species, including endosymbionts and prey species present in stomach contents. Commonly used universal primers for smaller regions caused some taxa to be excluded due to primer-mismatch, resulting in detection of at most 85 percent of the expected species. \nSignificance\nThe use of blended macrofauna samples eliminates the need for cumbersome morphological identification. In addition, this method increases the number of species retrieved from samples, as it will also pick up species that are only present as gut contents. The method is promising for uniform evaluation of freshwater macrofauna in water quality assessment and food web studies.</string>
    <string name="id276">Presenting Author: Serrao, Natasha\n\nContact: natasha.rosemary.serrao@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Natasha Serrao, Scott Reid, Chris Wilson\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEffective management of endangered species requires sensitive detection of their occurrences, which is often difficult for low-abundance species. In aquatic environments, detection of rare species can be further confounded by site accessibility, sampling gear, and capture efficiency, with direct observation being difficult at best. Redside Dace, an endangered species native to southern Ontario, has been experiencing population declines as a result of habitat fragmentation. Traditional methods to detect their presence include seining and electrofishing; however, species often go undetected even if present at the site. A novel application of DNA barcoding has been to develop species-specific detection in aquatic habitats from environmental DNA (eDNA). The utility of this methodology was tested at 29 sites where Redside Dace were historically known to be present. \nResults\nThe combined results indicate that eDNA is a more sensitive method for species detection than conventional methodology. The study determined that seasonality, temporal versus spatial replicate sampling, and appropriate thresholds for classifying detections versus non-detections are important for study design. \nSignificance\neDNA is a reliable method for species detection in freshwater systems and can be used as an effective sampling technique for documenting occurrences of aquatic endangered species.</string>
    <string name="id474">Presenting Author: King, Ian\n\nContact: kingi@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Ian King, Steven Hill, Jim Bogart, Shadi Shokralla, Mehrdad Hajibabaei\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nUse of environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to greatly improve our knowledge of biodiversity and thereby help reduce threats to it. Much of the impetus for the development of eDNA methods has been the need to detect and monitor endangered organisms, so it is crucial to expedite the standardization of eDNA monitoring protocols. Collecting eDNA is a form of non-destructive sampling, which is especially important in situations where endangered or “at risk” species are being monitored. One such case is the endangered Jefferson Salamander (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) and other congenerics in southern Ontario. \nResults\nWe conducted a case study on using eDNA to improve monitoring of salamanders in the genus Ambystoma. We collected water samples from various ponds in southern Ontario where Jefferson salamanders had been previously observed. Using tissue samples, multiple specimens of A. jeffersonianum, two congenerics, and multiple polyploids that are commonly found in the geographic range of A. jeffersonianum were barcoded using standard sequencing primers. The DNA barcodes were compiled into a database that served as an Ambystoma sequence library. We designed three primer sets based on the sequences in this library. Environmental DNA extracted from the pond water samples was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using these primer sets. A comparison of the eDNA sequences to the Ambystoma sequence library showed positive matches, thereby confirming the successful detection of targeted salamanders from water samples via eDNA. \nSignificance\nCurrent monitoring methods for salamanders rely on observation of individuals or egg masses, and identification to species can be difficult. This problem is compounded by the complex genetic system of Ambystoma, including the presence of unisexual individuals. Based on our results, our method will allow for more accurate detection and for a longer time window than is currently possible.</string>

We developed a set of universal PCR primers (MiFish-U/E) for metabarcoding environmental DNA (eDNA) from fishes. \nResults\nThe primer design was based on the aligned whole-mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) sequences from 880 species, supplemented by partial mitogenome sequences from 160 elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). The primers target a hypervariable region of the 12S rRNA gene (163–185 bp), which contains sufficient information to identify fishes to taxonomic family, genus, and species except for some closely related congeners. To test the versatility of the primers across a diverse range of fishes, we sampled eDNA from four tanks in the Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium with known species compositions, prepared dual-indexed libraries, and performed paired-end sequencing of the region using high-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies. Out of the 180 marine fish species contained in the four tanks with reference sequences in a custom database, we detected 168 species (93.3 percent) distributed across 59 families and 123 genera. These fishes are not only taxonomically diverse—including sharks, rays, and higher teleosts—but are also greatly varied in their ecology, including both pelagic and benthic species living in shallow coastal to deep waters. We also sampled natural seawaters around coral reefs near the aquarium and detected 93 fish species using this approach. Of the 93 species, 64 were not detected in the four aquarium tanks, rendering the total number of species detected as 232, belonging to 70 families and 152 genera. \nSignificance\nThe metabarcoding approach presented here is non-invasive, more efficient, more cost-effective, and more sensitive than the traditional survey methods. It has the potential to serve as an alternative (or complementary) tool for biodiversity monitoring that revolutionises natural resource management and ecological studies of fish communities on larger spatial and temporal scales.</string>

Wilson\n\nAbstract:\nBackgroundAccess to DNA barcodes allows for rapid development of species-specific markers. The environmental DNA (eDNA) method is able to target DNA present within the environment as a result of excretion, release of gametes, and shed epidermal cells. Determining the occurrence and site occupancy of rare and endangered species can be challenging, particularly in aquatic systems where organisms are often underwater and hidden from view. Barcode-based eDNA detection was used to assess habitat occupancy of spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), which is federally listed as “Threatened” in Canada, with known occurrences limited to a small number of locations in southern Ontario. Water samples were collected in the spring at six locations based on distribution information. Within these locations, 10-16 sites were sampled by taking 3-5 replicate water samples. Additionally, sites were sampled for spotted gar using hoop nets. \nResults\nPCR assays were developed targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI) to detect spotted gar eDNA using both conventional and quantitative PCR (qPCR). DNA from spotted gar was detected in all but one previously recorded site, and the eDNA method was shown to be more effective than traditional netting for detecting spotted gar habitat use. The use of qPCR allowed for quantification of substantial variation in detection strength (copy number) among replicate eDNA samples, with implications for establishing sampling designs for detection and surveillance. \nSignificance\nThe use of eDNA for detection and monitoring aquatic species shows great potential as a non-invasive method for assessing species occurrences and habitat occupancy, as well as for informing targeted sampling by conventional capture methods.6</string>

Traditional monitoring approaches impede data collection because they can be laborious, expensive, and struggle to detect cryptic diversity. Monitoring approaches using mammal DNA derived from invertebrates has recently been suggested as cost- and time-effective alternatives. As a step towards development of blowfly-derived DNA as an effective method for mammal monitoring in tropical biodiversity hotspots (e.g., Peninsular Malaysia), we (i) designed and tested primers that can selectively amplify mammal cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA mini-barcodes in the presence of high concentrations of blowfly DNA; (ii) determined the persistence period of amplifiable mammal mtDNA in blowfly guts through a laboratory feeding experiment; (iii) evaluated the effectiveness of blowfly-derived mammal DNA in generating species inventories as compared to other traditional approaches (i.e., cage trapping, mist netting, hair trapping, and scat collection). A short (205 bp) mammal COI DNA mini-barcode, suitable for high-throughput sequencing, could distinguish most mammal species (including separating dark taxa). The persistence period of amplifiable mammal DNA in blowfly guts was in the range of 24 h to 96 h post-feeding—this indicates the need for retrieving flies within 24 h of capture to detect mammal mtDNA in sufficient quantity and quality. Field surveys in Ulu Gombak Forest Reserve using different sampling methods (November to December 2014) revealed that the blowfly-derived DNA approach obtained the most diverse samples. This includes a near-threatened species, Trachypithecus obscurus, the dusky leaf monkey, which is a new record for the forest reserve.</string>

This technique is increasingly being used to track the spread of invasive fish species but has largely not been applied to other taxonomic groups. However, the low impact of eDNA sampling on aquatic habitats makes the method ideal for sampling sensitive populations. Here we report on research that aims to quantify the opportunities and limitations of eDNA for the detection of rare, endangered organisms. Our study focuses on the detection of native freshwater mussel (Unionidae) species at risk using species-specific qPCR markers. We will use a multi-species approach to develop highly specific markers for each of the five closely related species. \nResults\nTo date, species-specific qPCR primer-probe sets have been developed, validated under controlled conditions, and implemented across the species’ ranges to map occurrences. The eDNA-derived species occurrences will be compared with existing distribution maps to evaluate the efficacy of the method. \nSignificance\neDNA shows promise as an effective tool for the targeted detection of closely related at-risk invertebrates; however, a thorough knowledge of the detection thresholds and limitations of the eDNA tools is crucial for meaningful interpretation of results and the eventual use of eDNA for management applications.</string>

Phillips\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBiodiversity assessments are a common feature of offshore oil and gas industry environmental monitoring programs, used to assess potential adverse impacts of drilling operations. Traditional methods include assessing the taxonomic diversity and abundance of benthic organisms from a network of sampling localities. Organisms are isolated from sediment by sieving and manually picking followed by microscopic examination and identification by experts. \nResults\nIn this study, deepwater sediments—provided as part of a benthic-monitoring program—were evaluated by both traditional methods and by extraction and analysis of DNA. The objective of this initial study was to provide a proof-of-concept evaluation of environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for obtaining information about benthic community composition from deepwater sediments. The results of the study include a list of organisms identified for each sample locality based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and a comparison against taxonomic lists obtained by traditional methods. \nSignificance\nMolecular approaches, such as DNA barcoding and eDNA, offer an alternative method that could ultimately be less expensive, safer, and more accurate than traditional methods of biodiversity assessment.</string>

Fox\n\nAbstract:\nEnvironmental DNA (eDNA) detection based on DNA barcoding is an efficient method for detecting target species at low population densities, where traditional census methods often fail. The sensitivity of the eDNA method may improve conservation management strategies in response to species invasions by enabling their detection at early invasion stages before effective response options become limited. We tested the efficiency of the eDNA method in tracking an invasive population of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) at an early stage of invasion. Paired testing of both eDNA and a traditional survey method (angling) was used to monitor the expansion of round goby along its invasive pathway in the Trent-Severn Waterway in Central Ontario. The efficiency of the eDNA method was also assessed by comparing the pattern of decrease in population density toward the expansion front as measured by angling, with the strength of eDNA signal. We also tested the effects of distance from the expansion front, habitat type, depth, and water flow on the eDNA signal. Appropriate sampling and extraction methods were developed to optimize final DNA yield and detection accuracy. The eDNA was shown to detect the presence of round goby upstream from where the species was detected with the traditional survey method. Our results indicate that a well-designed monitoring protocol using eDNA would enhance our ability to detect a species invasion, which should increase the likelihood of successful control.</string>

Southwestern China is a biodiversity hotspot and a paradise for mushroom enthusiasts and connoisseurs. Wild mushrooms from that region are exported to many markets both within and outside of China. However, the true biodiversity of wild edible mushrooms from that region remains to be defined. \nResults\nIn this study, we sampled the wild edible mushroom markets throughout southwest China and obtained ITS sequences from 1908 samples representing the major morphological types of wild edible mushrooms. Our sequence analyses identified that these samples belonged to at least 40 genera in 25 fungal families. Among the 1908 analyzed samples, 952 (49.9 percent) were found to share >97 percent of ITS sequence identity to the 68 closest-known species in databases; 179 (9.4 percent) shared 95-97 percent ITS sequence identity with the 25 closest-known species; 474 (24.8 percent) shared 90-95 percent ITS sequence identity with the 36 closest-known species; and 303 (15.9 percent) shared <90 percent ITS sequence identity with the 35 closest-known species. Three genera—Lactarius, Ramaria, and Russula—had the highest number of (putative) species in the wild mushroom markets. \nSignificance\nOur results suggest a large cryptic mushroom biodiversity in this region and that more than half of the wild edible mushrooms in the markets belong to undescribed taxa.]]></string>

Mould in buildings is positively associated with several allergic and respiratory effects, and certain moulds are toxigenic, meaning that they can produce mycotoxins. Indoor fungi are identified traditionally by culture-dependent methods, which inevitably have a low resolution. In the present study, to increase accuracy in analyses and to provide useful data for end-users, we conducted DNA metabarcoding of the nuclear ITS2 region for indoor fungal samples. \nResults\nBoth presumptive problem buildings and control buildings were sampled multiple times, one of the buildings both before and after a major renovation. Good-quality sequences were obtained, and the results showed that DNA metabarcoding gives a high resolution in fungal identification. The diversity and composition of fungal classes, orders, families, genera, and species varied considerably among samples; not only among samples from different buildings, but also among samples from the same building. Also, temporal variation was detected. Great variation among samples even within the same building emphasizes the importance of multiple sampling. We found that taxonomic diversity of fungi as such is not a good indicator of indoor air quality—a diverse array of fungi occurs even in a normal indoor environment. It is rather the presence of certain fungal taxa and the relative proportion of fungi and plants (primarily pollen) that are potential indicators of air quality. \nSignificance\nThe increased precision obtained through DNA metabarcoding provides a potentially useful tool for analysing indoor mycoflora.</string>

For these taxa, alternative barcode loci needed to be identified to ensure the accurate and reliable identification of species in a clinical setting. Potential alternative loci with high levels of informativeness were identified by whole-genome comparison of 25 fungal species. As a result, the three most-informative regions: EF1, EF3, and 60S were selected as alternative barcode candidates. Novel, allegedly universal primer pairs were designed from the whole-genome data for these regions. As part of a pilot study, the three new loci and a total set of nine primer pairs were tested on pathogenic fungal species—including filamentous fungi and yeasts—to evaluate their amplification efficiency under standardized laboratory conditions and the universality of the primers across different taxa. The amplified fragments were sequenced, and the average intraspecies variations were defined. Barcoding gaps were calculated at the interspecies level to evaluate the resolution and discriminatory power of the novel loci. In pathogenic fungi, the translation elongation factor 1α gene (tef1α) amplified with the “Al33 primers set” proved to be the most promising candidate for an alternative barcode in pathogenic fungi. The amplified region showed less variability at the species level than the ITS region, and it proved to yield a higher resolution at the interspecies level, thereby enabling the separation of numerous closely related/cryptic species, such as Cryptococcus. It also improved the size of the barcoding gap in other taxa including the Debaryomycetaceae. As such, the tef1α locus is a promising secondary barcode candidate for the identification of clinically relevant species. However, further studies are necessary to test the suitability of tef1α as an alternative barcode and subsequently a new public reference sequence repository needs to be created.</string>

Barcoding lichens—especially crustose lichens—using Sanger sequencing can be problematic as saprophytic, endophytic, and parasitic fungi live intimately admixed with the lichen mycobiont, which results in low quality sequencing reads. We sampled 100 epiphytic lichen species from the order Lecanorales (Ascomycota) from Switzerland to test barcoding of the mycobiont using fungal-specific molecular markers in high-throughput 454 sequencing in a GS FLX System. Additionally, we aimed to gain better insight into insufficiently explored epi- and endo-lichenic fungal diversity. \nResults\nPyrosequencing of 100 lichens resulted in a total of 128,449 reads. The full fungal ITS region (“barcode”) of the lichen mycobiont was recovered for all sequenced species except one. In 26 samples, multiple ITS versions of expected mycobiont were detected. Besides the target mycobiont, many other fungi were identified within our samples—on average 11 fungal lineages per lichen sample. Many of these were identified as highly specific lichen-associated (facultative parasites/lichenicolous) or plant-associated (epi- or endo-phytes) fungi; others seem to be generalists with similar fungal lineages shared in a variety of lichen samples, independent of growth form (foliose/fruticose vs crustose thallus), chemical composition, or substrate tree species. \nSignificance\nOur study shows the potential of DNA barcoding using high-throughput 454 sequencing in lichen identification. We demonstrate that GenBank can be used as a reference database as the majority of lichen species were identified correctly to species or at least genus level. The lichen-associated fungal community proves to be much more diverse than previously sampling suggested.</string>

The discovery of additional new yeast species in the Lodderomyces clade is important for a better understanding of its taxonomy and the evolution of pathogenecity in yeasts. \nResults\nA survey of yeasts associated with insects conducted in Bulgaria using DNA barcoding analysis of combined sequences of the D1/D2 domains of the large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) and the ITS1+2 regions showed that seven yeast strains represented two novel yeast species and a new yeast genus near the Candida parapsilosis species complex. \nSignificance\nOur results showed that LSU rDNA and ITS markers have good discriminatory power for well-supported separation of all subclades and the species of the Lodderomyces clade. The results provided strong support for the suggestion that insects are the major vectors for dispersal in nature of human pathogenic yeasts, and they may play an important role in the evolution of the pathogenicity of these yeasts.</string>
    <string name="id309">Presenting Author: Meyer, Wieland\n\nContact: wieland.meyer@sydney.edu.au\n\nAuthors: Wieland Meyer, Laszlo Irinyi\n\nAbstract:\nThe numbers of human and animal fungal infections have increased significantly in the last decade, causing serious public health burdens and increased risk of biodiversity loss among animal species. Correct and fast identification of the causative agents of mycoses is of great importance to enable early diagnosis and targeted antifungal therapy. DNA barcoding offers an accurate, fast, cost-effective, culture-independent approach for species identification. The current generally agreed upon fungal DNA barcode is the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), but its widespread application in clinical settings has been limited due to the lack of quality-controlled reference databases. Recently, an international consortium of medical mycology laboratories established the ISHAM-ITS database, the first fungal barcode database for human and animal pathogenic fungi. The database is available from http://www.isham.org/ or directly at http://its.mycologylab.org/. It currently hosts 3200 complete ITS sequences covering 524 medically relevant fungal species, and it is open for further submission. It is intended to cover all medically important fungal species with a sufficient number of strains to represent the diversity of a species. The gathered data have been used to evaluate the value of the ITS region as a barcode at the intra- and inter-species levels. The intraspecies variation of the ITS sequences currently included in the database ranges from 0 to 2.25 percent, with 170 species having variation of less than 1.5 percent. At the interspecies level, several taxa were identified without a barcoding gap, and the ITS region was insufficient to discriminate between closely related/cryptic species. Overall, clinically important species show low intraspecies variability and a clear barcoding gap at interspecies level; consequently, ITS sequencing can be used for the identification of most of them. However, for the species with more than 1.5 percent diversity or taxa without a barcoding gap, alternative barcode loci need to be introduced to ensure reliable species identification.</string>

Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n The Global Malaise Program (GMP), a collaboration between the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) and an ever growing number of international contributors, represents a first step toward the acquisition of detailed temporal and spatial information on terrestrial arthropod communities across the globe. The standard methods of Malaise trapping and DNA barcoding makes it possible to carry out large-scale sampling programs and enables a time- and cost-efficient approach for biodiversity assessments. \nResults\n To date, 63 sites from 30 countries have participated in GMP. From 2012-2014, Malaise traps were deployed in ecosystems as diverse as Arctic tundra to tropical dry forest, running anywhere from 4-62 weeks with samples collected weekly. Over 638K specimens have been sorted from 36 sites (21 different countries), and a total of 65,841 BINs were discovered. Identifications were assigned by the BOLD-ID Engine where possible, allowing preliminary species inventories to be completed for each location and facilitating comparisons among them. As expected, species similarity was negatively correlated to the distance between sites (p < 0.001) as well as the latitudinal difference between sites (p < 0.001). However, there is no evidence for higher species diversity in the tropics (i.e. the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient; p > 0.10) although many confounding variables are at play. \nSignificance\n Over the coming years, accumulated results from this project will help establish comprehensive knowledge of species distributions and prevalence, which is critical for the accurate evaluation of anthropogenic impacts. This project will also allow researchers to explore patterns of global biodiversity across latitudes, ecosystems, seasons, and more. Furthermore, these established locations could act as nodes for more intense, localized sampling efforts, paving the way for a globally connected bio-monitoring program.]]></string>

Mason\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThere is a considerable taxonomic impediment that prevents further advances in the knowledge of microgastrine wasps in the Holarctic region, which has resulted in species being described twice (as different) on both sides of the Atlantic, holotypes scattered across many collections, numerous morphologically cryptic species, and a lack of studies from a truly Holarctic perspective. As a result, only 26 percent of the 1,000+ species recorded from the region are known from both Europe and North America, while a significant number of undescribed or unreported species remain, especially in the Nearctic and Eastern Palaearctic. \nResults\nUsing an integrative taxonomic approach, DNA barcodes of 10,000+ samples from wasp specimens in European and Canadian collections were analyzed together with morphological, biological (hosts), and geographical data. These studies significantly increased the known distribution of many species within the Holarctic, uncovered new continental records (especially for North America), revealed a significant number of cryptic and new species, and confirmed the establishment of wasp species previously introduced for the biological control of Lepidoptera pests. \nSignificance\nThe new information available is applicable to conservation efforts, biological control programs, biodiversity inventories, taxonomic revisions, and ecological studies on this important group of parasitoid wasps. DNA barcoding arguably provides the fastest and easiest way to organize and critically analyze large datasets within taxonomically complex and hyperdiverse groups of insects such as Microgastrinae.</string>
    <string name="id408">Presenting Author: McGee, Katie\n\nContact: kmcgee@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Katie McGee, Mehrdad Hajibabaei, Bill Eaton, Olivia Karas\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Northern Zone of Costa Rica has experienced extraction-based land management practices for the past 40 years, resulting in a 70 percent reduction of lowland forests, which have likely impacted the soil biota and carbon and nitrogen nutrient cycle activities. Development of secondary forests has been used as a remediation strategy; however, conservation managers are concerned that these secondary forests are not regenerating at traditional rates. Therefore, it is critical to determine how these practices impact the soil biotic ecosystems, yet too few studies have examined this in the tropics. Thus, an eDNA metasystematic study was conducted to assess the effects of land management on soil microbial (16S and ITS gene regions) and arthropod (COI gene region) populations, as well as carbon and nitrogen dynamics in Costa Rica. Soils were studied from three unique habitats originally part of a large tract of upland primary forest in the Northern Zone of Costa Rica, and that were managed differently in the past 35 years (approximately): 1) unharvested primary forest; 2) secondary forest cleared 32 years ago and allowed to regenerate following clearing; 3) secondary forest cleared 32 years ago and used for pasture for ~10 years before allowing it to regenerate. \nResults\nThe results of this study show statistically significant differences between soil nutrient and biotic data among all three of the habitat soils examined, as determined by ANOVA followed by post-hoc analyses. In addition, the overall relatedness of the soil biotic and abiotic data across the habitats was determined via ANOSIM using a Bray-Curtis index. \nSignificance\nThe data from this study suggest that two differently managed secondary forests can affect the soil biotic and abiotic components, such that one regime is less conducive to efficient carbon utilization in growth and biomass development, and thus carbon sequestration. These metrics could prove useful as determinants of ecosystem condition, and their utility in restoration ecology warrants further investigation.</string>

This project aims to address this gap through DNA barcoding of the fauna. We also compared the mangrove arthropod communities to sequences of individuals from other forest types and available on BOLD. \nResults\nOver one year, a total of 8,254 individuals were collected, and 251 were sequenced. COI sequences were congruent with morphospecies designations. The sequences formed 101 BINs, 39 percent of which contained specimens from outside of New Zealand. Preliminary results show roughly 50 percent of species found at the Thames sites had not been previously found in an inland habitat. \nSignificance\nThis research project will generate baseline data that may be used by future projects investigating topics such as species invasions, climate change, and mangrove ecosystem function. By assessing the diversity of the invertebrates at sites of varying age and health, it may also be possible to identify indicator species useful to environmental monitoring programs. With mangrove expansion and removal being a contentious issue in some coastal communities, improving our understanding of the terrestrial invertebrate communities in these habitats will facilitate appropriate conservation strategies.</string>

Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nWith 45,000 known species in 114 families, spiders are one of the most diverse orders of arthropods. Similar to other arthropod taxa, many spiders are difficult to identify morphologically. Therefore, DNA barcode libraries can help to alleviate these identification challenges. This study provides a DNA barcode reference library for 1,103 (75 percent) of the 1,460 species of spiders previously reported from Canada, based upon the analysis of more than 45,000 specimens. \nResults\nThe majority (96 percent) of the specimens analyzed were acquired through sampling programs led by the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario that employed diverse methods, including hand collecting, sieving, sweep netting, and trapping (Malaise, pan, pitfall, sticky), and that focused on National Park collections though the BIObus field teams. The spider sequences were assigned to 1,439 Barcode Index Numbers (BINs), with 1,216 of these BINs composed of specimens belonging to a single currently recognized species. There was a perfect correspondence between BIN membership and a known species in 816 cases, while another 223 species were assigned to two or more BINs. A small proportion of species (2 percent) was involved in BIN merges or in a combination of merges and splits. \nSignificance\nBecause 98 percent of the species possessed a diagnostic array of sequences, the present DNA barcode reference library will be highly effective for enabling barcode-based identification of Canadian spiders. This study revealed that nearest neighbour distances for Canadian spiders were 10 times higher than maximum intraspecific values (averages of 7.85 percent versus 0.78 percent, respectively). These measures of variation presume that the current taxonomic system is valid and that all specimens have been correctly identified. The few species lacking barcode divergence need to be investigated to validate their reproductive isolation by testing for sequence divergence at nuclear loci, ideally at localities where they are sympatric. The generation of a barcode reference library for Canadian spiders revealed 17 morphological distinct undescribed species. Also, 60 species were newly recorded for Canada, with first records also presented for eight genera and one family.</string>
    <string name="id355">Presenting Author: Savage, Jade \n\nContact: jsavage@ubishops.ca\n\nAuthors: Jade Savage, Paul Hebert, Valérie Lévesque-Beaudin\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Muscidae (house-flies and relatives) is an ecologically diverse family of Diptera found in a wide range of terrestrial and freshwater habitats. In Canada, the group is especially well represented in alpine and northern environments where they often account for more than 25 percent of all Diptera species. Muscids have recently been the focus of various ecological and monitoring studies in alpine, northern, and agricultural habitats; however, the large number of species and the difficulties associated with morphology-based identification (especially of females) remain important challenges. Previous work has demonstrated a high correspondence between morphology and DNA barcodes for muscid flies. Using the largest data set available to date, the present study aims at populating a complete reference library of DNA barcodes (COI) for the Canadian muscid fauna, which is thought to include approximately 500 species. \nResults\nOur data set includes 22,386 sequences representing 438 operational taxonomic units under the Barcoding Index Number (BIN) system, half of which are already determined to species. Based on morphological examination of representative specimens, we have now completed a generic assignment for all BINs. Preliminary results on species-level identification generally indicate strong correspondence between BINs and morphology, with occasional cases of over-splitting or over-lumping. We also report rare cases where morphologically distinct taxa shared identical barcodes. \nSignificance\nOur DNA barcode reference library for the Muscidae of Canada will be relevant to the fields of agriculture, conservation, and vector biology by: 1) improving our ability to properly assess the status of both invasive and native members of the Canadian insect fauna; and 2) facilitating future investigations into the community ecology, biodiversity, and monitoring of insect assemblages, especially in northern Canada.</string>

Beermann, Volodymyr Pushkar, Rüdiger Wagner, Florian Leese\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding has often been demonstrated to be superior to traditional biodiversity assessments. Yet, in most of these comparisons, morphological species determinations have not been performed by expert taxonomists or they have used immature life stages, rendering the comparisons of resolution as inappropriate. Here, we used species-level data obtained by expert taxonomists from male adult insects and compared the resolution of DNA-based and morphological determinations side-by-side. As a case study, we used the Breitenbach (Hesse, Germany). With more than 50 years of research and over 1,800 reported metazoan species, the Breitenbach is one of the ecologically and taxonomically best-studied freshwater ecosystems. \nResults\nWe collected more than 11,000 adult insects with emergence traps over one year. For more than 200 morphospecies, up to 20 DNA barcodes per species were generated. The comparison of DNA-based and morphological species assignments revealed a high congruency between both approaches (~89 percent match). However, for several important indicator taxa, DNA barcoding identified unrecognized species diversity (9 percent) and cases of unnecessarily split species (2 percent). In at least one case (Sericostoma sp.), DNA barcoding suggested the presence of two species, whereas microsatellites revealed the presence of a single species (populations in secondary contact). \nSignificance\nMorphological identifications by expert taxonomists provide reliable and high-resolution biodiversity information even without DNA barcoding. However, in most cases (in particular ongoing biomonitoring programs), species identification is performed not by taxonomic experts and is often done using immature life stages of freshwater insects. This leads to a significant mismatch between the true and the inferred stream biodiversity, which has potential negative consequences for management. Therefore, as demonstrated in this study, DNA barcoding provides a unique tool to quantify species diversity independently of the taxonomic expertise and the life stages available and thus significantly improves biodiversity assessments.</string>

In addition to the use of traditional methods for specimen collection and morphological identification, we are using DNA barcoding of individual specimens and developing novel molecular techniques that use high-throughput sequencing technology to aid in the identification of benthic invertebrate and fish species. Techniques employing next-generation sequencing currently in development include: fish diet (gut content) analysis, environmental DNA (eDNA), and sampling preservative ethanol (from Surber samples). \nResults\nThroughout the 2013 and 2014 field seasons, benthic invertebrates, fish, and eDNA samples were collected at multiple sites from 14 permanent streams located in both coastal mountain and interior plateau ecosystem units. Benthic invertebrate and fish identification, and fish gut content analysis results to date, including comparison of morphological and molecular methods, will be presented. \nSignificance\nMorphological identification and subsequent DNA barcoding of benthic invertebrates have revealed important limitations in understanding taxonomic resolution using traditional methods, as well as the immense potential for species discovery and expansion of known distribution ranges in a very understudied region of Canada.</string>

Young, Jeremy R. deWaard\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nMolluscs are the most endangered group of invertebrates in Canada, and there is a need to document biodiversity in this phylum. This group has seen substantial declines due to the presence of invasive mussels in our waterways and because many species are sensitive to environmental change. As such, we are constructing a DNA barcode reference library for Canada’s freshwater mussels as well as testing the utility of two non-invasive methods for obtaining barcodes: visceral swabs from live specimens and periostracum scrapings from dry shells in natural history collections. \nResults\nBarcode records for more than half of Canada’s 54 freshwater mussel species have been compiled. We observed 65 percent sequencing success with visceral swabs and 1 percent with periostracum scrapings, suggesting additional work is needed to enhance success in the latter. A preliminary experiment demonstrated a 1.4-fold increase in sequencing success (92 percent) with swabs from store-bought blue mussels, suggesting that in situ specimens face additional issues with PCR inhibition, likely caused by excessive polysaccharides. Low success from dry museum samples is likely a result of DNA degradation and may be combated through the use of internal primers. \nSignificance\nA DNA barcode reference library for Canadian freshwater mussels is an essential platform for future work, particularly for the detection of aquatic species from water samples using environmental DNA. Our study highlights the use of unconventional methods for DNA barcoding, having important implications for the utilization of dry shell collections in natural history archives. The optimization of field and laboratory protocols will increase sequence acquisition from future collections as well as make monitoring faster, easier, and more objective. In all, this work has advanced our understanding of freshwater mussel diversity in Canada and presents new methods for obtaining DNA barcodes from threatened populations.</string>

Here, we compare the performance of five different DNA extraction protocols and direct PCR in isolation of DNA from chironomid pupal exuviae. Chironomidae (Insecta: Diptera) is a group of species-rich aquatic macroinvertebrates widely distributed in freshwater environments and considered valuable bioindicators of water quality. A commonly used form of sampling chironomids involves collection of pupal exuviae. Thus, using DNA barcoding to identify chironomid pupal exuviae can be an important asset to understanding freshwater ecology as well as advancing chironomid taxonomy through life stage associations. \nResults\nGenomic DNA was extracted from 61.2 percent of 570 sampled pupal exuviae. Several of the extracts were contaminated with DNA from non-target organisms; only 13.7 percent of the sequences produced from these extracts matched chironomid sequences. There were significant differences in the extraction methods and direct PCR with regards to cost, handling time, DNA quantity, PCR success, sequence success, and the ability to sequence target taxa. The NucleoSpin® Tissue XS Kit, DNeasy® Blood and Tissue kit, and QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution provided the best results in isolating DNA from single pupal exuviae. Direct PCR and DTAB/CTAB methods gave poor results. \nSignificance\nThe observed differences in DNA extraction protocol performance on trace DNA should be of interest to studies focusing on noninvasive sampling in aquatic environments, such as environmental barcoding and metabarcoding.</string>

However, most studies have been focused on relatively small datasets or on large datasets of taxonomically high-ranked groups. We explore how well DNA barcodes delimit species in the diverse chironomid genus Tanytarsus (Diptera: Chironomidae) by using different analytical tools. Tanytarsus is the most species-rich genus of tribe Tanytarsini (Diptera: Chironomidae) with more than 400 species worldwide, some of which can be notoriously difficult to identify to species level. Our dataset, based on sequences generated from own material and publicly available data in BOLD, consist of 2790 DNA barcodes > 500 bp long. A neighbor joining tree of this dataset comprises 131 well-separated clusters representing 77 named, 15 unnamed, and 28 unidentified theoretical morphological species of Tanytarsus. For our geographically widespread dataset, DNA barcodes unambiguously discriminate 94.6 percent of the Tanytarsus species recognized through prior morphological study. Deep intraspecific divergences exist in some species complexes, and need further taxonomic studies using appropriate nuclear markers as well as morphological and ecological data to be resolved. The DNA barcodes cluster into 120–242 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs) depending on whether Objective Clustering, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), subjective evaluation of the neighbor joining tree, or Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) are used. We demonstrate that a 4–5 percent threshold is appropriate to delineate species of Tanytarsus non-biting midges.]]></string>

Chironomids are found in almost all kinds of terrestrial and aquatic habitats but are particularly species rich and abundant in freshwaters. Many species have specific habitat requirements, and chironomids are therefore well suited for biological monitoring as well as research projects focused on evolution and biogeography. However, the full potential remains unleashed as many species are difficult to identify, and a large number still is undescribed. DNA barcoding of Chironomidae therefore represents a great tool for the advanced use of non-biting midges in research and nature management. \nResults\nWe summarize our work on DNA barcoding of Chironomidae over the last 9 years based on more than 6000 records of 900 named species (1267 BINs) in BOLD. Focus is on analytical success, the importance of vouchers, association of life stages, detection of cryptic diversity, and the lack of genetic variation. \nSignificance\nA DNA barcode library provides a common base for species interpretation and paves the way for a broader use of Chironomidae in environmental studies and biosystematics.</string>

Miller, Sean Prosser\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nOne of the major challenges in creating a global database like BOLD is warranting the correct identification of the voucher specimens. The strict BOLD policy to require images, indication of specimen deposition, and accurate geo-referencing for all submitted datasets is extremely helpful to control doubtful data and potential misidentifications. Nevertheless, there are still many incomplete identifications (to genus or subfamily level), interim names, or even misidentifications on BOLD, mainly for species from tropical regions. Unfortunately, experts are lacking for many problematic groups and regions, and even when there are experts, they usually are not available for correcting the taxonomy of large amounts of data due to time constraints. \nResults\nThe best way to reliably calibrate the system is to barcode the original type specimens. In recent years, the challenge of sequencing up to 250-year old museum specimens has been overcome by improved techniques and protocols developed by the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding. These innovations allowed for the generation of barcode sequences for approximately 2,700 geometrid type specimens, which represent 2,150 species corresponding to about 9 percent of the 23,000 described species worldwide. \nSignificance\nHere, we present case studies to show the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of this approach as well as promising strategies to complete the calibration of the reference library within a reasonable amount of time.</string>
    <string name="id57">Presenting Author: Prosser, Sean\n\nContact: sprosser@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Sean Prosser, Jeremy deWaard, Scott Miller, Paul Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nType specimens have high scientific importance because they provide the only certain connection between the application of a Linnean name and a physical specimen. Many other individuals may have been identified as a particular species, but their linkage to the taxon concept is inferential. Because type specimens are often more than a century old and have experienced conditions unfavorable for DNA preservation, success in sequence recovery has been uncertain. The present study addresses this challenge by employing next-generation sequencing (NGS) to recover sequences for the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from small amounts of template DNA. \nResults\nDNA quality was first screened in more than 1800 type specimens of Lepidoptera by attempting to recover 164bp and 94bp reads via Sanger sequencing. This analysis permitted the assignment of each specimen to one of three DNA quality categories – high (164bp sequence), medium (94bp sequence), or low (no sequence). Ten century-old specimens from each category were subsequently analyzed via a NGS protocol requiring just 4 µL of template DNA. Sequence information was recovered from all specimens with average read lengths ranging from 458bp to 610bp for the three DNA categories. \nSignificance\nWith very little effort, 658bp barcodes can be recovered from type specimens even in cases where DNA degradation is too high for traditional Sanger sequencing. By sequencing ten specimens in each NGS run, costs were similar to Sanger analysis. Future increases in the number of specimens processed in each run promise substantial reductions in cost, making it possible to anticipate a future where barcode sequences are available from most type specimens.</string>

In 2014, under a Canada-Peru Cooperation Agreement, the Museum welcomed a barcoding initiative that helped to process a sample of our botanical and zoological collections. In the process, we standardized protocols and improved data collection and collection management in general. These activities fell within the overall goal of strengthening capacities for DNA barcoding in the country. \nRESULTS\nThe USM Herbarium and various departments in the Zoology Division sent a total of 2,489 samples to the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO). The bird samples represent 60 percent of Peruvian bird species. Samples from the Departments of Entomology (95), Mammalogy (285), and the USM Herbarium (190) were analyzed in order to validate their identities, and allow them to be used in phylogenetic reconstructions. Bird samples came from different projects, a very important one of which was the characterization of bird species associated with trade and increased industrial activity to examine potential impacts on the biota. \nSIGNIFICANCE\nAt the end of the project, we expect to identify 20 species of birds that are important for control of illegal trade (Business Calendar by the Ministries of Environment and Agriculture) and 26 species important in environmentally sustainable agroecosystems (AGROKASA company). In the last decade, Peru has experienced significant economic growth, mainly from mining, hydrocarbon, and hydroelectric industries. Six species collected from the Camisea oil extraction project, 25 species from the Alto Chicama and Conga mine, and six species from a hydroelectric project are scheduled to be barcoded.</string>

Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nHigh rates of loss and species discovery have lead to the urgent need for more rapid assessments of species diversity and distribution in the herpetofauna, an approach now offered through DNA barcoding. Prior DNA barcoding work on reptiles and amphibians has revealed higher biodiversity counts than previously estimated due to cases of cryptic and undiscovered species in both classes. Despite past research, these taxa are very much in need of comprehensive species-level coverage. \nResults\nThis study constructs a reference library of DNA barcodes for North American reptiles and amphibians and assesses their applicability as a technique for species delimitation. This study also examines the correspondence of current species boundaries with the BIN system. Barcodes were obtained from 732 specimens, representing 282 species (44 percent) of the North American herpetofauna. Mean intraspecific divergences were 1 percent and 3 percent, while average congeneric sequence divergences were 16 percent and 14 percent in amphibians and reptiles, respectively. BIN assignments corresponded perfectly with current species boundaries in 58 percent of these species. Barcode sharing was observed in four genera of reptiles, while deep divergences (>2 percent) were noted in 21 percent of the species. Using multiple primers and a refined PCR regime, barcode fragments were recovered from 5 of 208 formalin-fixed specimens, demonstrating that formalin collections can expand genetic databases. \nSignificance\nThis is the first effort to compile a reference library of DNA barcodes that provides species-level identifications for reptiles and amphibians across a broad geographic area. DNA barcodes from North American herpetofauna were used to quickly and effectively flag errors in museum collections, and cases of BIN splits and merges successfully identified taxa belonging to deeply diverged or hybridizing lineages. This study also highlights the merit of further investigation into obtaining genetic material from formalin-fixed tissue and the use of DNA barcodes for biodiversity forensics.]]></string>

As a consequence, many specimens remain unassigned to a known taxon. DNA barcoding will help to improve our understanding of millions of specimens deposited in these repositories. The collection at the Museo de Herpetología Universidad de Antioquia (MHUA) in Colombia harbors more than 16,000 specimens of herpetofauna coming mostly from the northwestern corner in South America. This region is similar in area to Costa Rica, but it has more species, and only about 20 percent of the territory has been sampled in comparison to the well-studied Central America\'s country. Here, we sequenced the COI fragment along with other mitochondrial and nuclear markers. We used monophyly, genetic distance, and the Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery method to define evolutionary units. \nResults\nWe have sequenced more than 800 specimens of 217 nominal species. Preliminary analyses show hidden diversity in the amphibian genera Pristimantis, Craugastor, Colostethus, and Bolitoglossa. High Andes assemblage barcodes highlight lineage divergence concordant with mountain islands. Regarding reptiles, hidden diversity has been detected in the lizard genera Cercosaura and Anolis. In contrast, barcodes have also shown that highly polymorphic species are genetically indistinct, suggesting a decoupling of phenotype and genotype in the Neotropical herpetofauna. These results have fired up species descriptions, and six new taxa are currently in the process of description. \nSignificance\nRecent studies have demonstrated the outstanding underestimation of Neotropical biodiversity when genetic data are analyzed. Thus, DNA barcoding represents an opportunity to better quantify the biodiversity in tropical countries that in turn will benefit all the areas that require information from natural history collections.</string>

Hebert, Jeremy R. deWaard\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Bio-Inventory and Collections Unit (BIC) of the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) has committed substantial resources to the collection of specimens from across Canada and the globe. This effort has paid off, as exemplified by the over 95,000 BINs on the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) that stem solely from BIC’s collecting efforts. The BIC’s natural history collection contains over 2 million voucher specimens; 80 percent have an associated cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode greater than 500bp, and 20 percent have images. Exciting opportunities for collaboration with other institutions are being pursued, first by the publication of large datasets on the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), and second by our expanding outgoing loan program. \nResults\nAs part of BIC’s commitment to open-access specimen data, it has contributed 320,000 specimen records to GBIF via Canadensys, which accounts for one-third of arthropod records on the Canadensys repository. Since 2012, BIC has loaned nearly 20,000 specimens to taxonomists around the world. Some of these loans were initiated by BIC to obtain identifications of unknown material, and other loans were initiated by taxonomists interested in viewing recently collected specimens from their area of interest. Case studies illustrate the ways in which BIC’s collection has contributed to work by taxonomists and biodiversity scientists. \nSignificance\nBIC’s ability to collect mass arthropod samples each field season combined with high-throughput specimen processing and DNA barcoding has created a constantly improving and evolving natural history collection. The pairing of our specimens with DNA barcode sequences means we are not constrained by the availability of taxonomists to sort and identify incoming material. With increased online visibility of the natural history collection, BIC is expanding its role as a valuable resource for researchers worldwide.</string>
    <string name="id11">Presenting Author: Kartavtsev, Yuri\n\nContact: yuri.kartavtsev48@hotmail.com\n\nAuthors: Yuri Kartavtsev\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n The paper briefly summarises the notion of hybrids and occurrence of hybridization events detected by molecular markers. Evidence on possible impact of genetic introgression on species integrity, evolutionary fate of species, including reticulation of phylogenetic lineages, and consistency with the main modern paradigm, Neo-Darwinism, are considered. Three main points are discussed: 1. What methods for hybrid detection and the estimation of genetic introgression or gene flow are most appropriate? 2. What facts obtained on gene introgression by mtDNA and nDNA markers are evidence for hybridization? 3. Does the literature contain a correspondence of data on molecular diversity in lineages with Biological Species Concept (BSC) or is reticulation a major trend? \nResults\nIt seems that claims on the disestablishment of the modern BSC paradigm due to wide-scale gene introgression and phylogeny reticulation are too premature, especially considering the long history of many hybrid zones. Contrary to this, evidence summarized in the literature shows that molecular genetic data are concordant with the BSC and Neo-Darwinism in general. It is clear that introgression exists, although even in a wide zone of Mytilus spp., for example, introgression may be quite restricted or be asymmetric, resulting in at least the “source” taxa remaining intact. \nSignificance\nIf we accept that the sexually reproducing species in marine and terrestrial realms are introgressed, then we should recognize that the orthodox biological species concept – in terms of complete absence of gene flow among species – is inadequate in a sense that many zoological species are not biological species yet. However, sooner or later zoological species definitely become biological species. Such a conclusion is supported by genetic distance increasing with taxon rank, with lowest diversity at intraspecies level and absence of interspecies reticulation for the majority of gene trees. These outcomes have great impacts to iBOL - FISH-BOL science policy and biological species identification in particular. This research is supported by RNF grant 14-50-00034.</string>

Adamowicz\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSince it was proposed in 2003, DNA barcoding has seen a dramatic rise as the standard molecular-based method for specimen identification for multicellular life. However, debate continues regarding the best conceptual and analytical approaches for identifying unknown specimens to the species level as well as for discovering new species. In particular, criticisms have been aimed at the frequent lack of statistical tests of explicit species hypotheses in the DNA barcoding literature, despite diverse discussions of species boundaries. Meanwhile, large DNA barcoding campaigns are generating continental-scale datasets of standardized DNA sequences for focal taxonomic groups that are nearly comprehensive at the species level, which can be used to address fundamental questions about the properties and origins of species. \nResults\nIn this opinion piece, I will first briefly review the history of application of species concepts in DNA barcoding studies. A gradual shift from morphological concepts towards concordance and evolutionary species concepts is apparent but not universal. Secondly, I will outline a research program in which large-scale barcode datasets are applied, together with other data types, to address elemental questions about the properties and evolutionary origins of species entities. For example, comparative barcode data from sexual vs. asexual taxa can help us to understand the strength of the role of reproductive isolation in the formation of discrete biological entities. \nSignificance\nCritical examination of barcode data will provide new insights into the nature of species. Furthermore, improved knowledge of the evolutionary history of species will contribute to selecting and operationalizing species concepts, which is of substantial practical importance for choosing appropriate analysis methods for specimen identification, species discovery, and species delimitation.</string>

Adamowicz\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBiodiversity surveys in the marine realm increasingly rely on the use of DNA barcoding and next-generation sequencing to describe whole communities and to assess the likely number of species present. Recent research has indicated the success of DNA barcoding for identifying specimens belonging to a wide range of animal taxa, including planktonic groups. The effectiveness and behaviour of methods for specimen identification and species delineation remain to be examined on a large scale for taxonomically diverse and widely distributed marine groups, such as the crustacean class Maxillopoda. This study investigates whether a biologically significant molecular threshold exists between intraspecific and interspecific divergences in maxillopods for the barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene. \nResults\nUsing a data set of all publically accessible maxillopod nucleotide sequences, we determined the most general threshold value for the maxillopods that separates apparent intraspecific from interspecific divergences, using different analytical methods (e.g. ABGD, jMOTU, UPARSE, mothur). We then compare the MOTUs generated using these threshold values and analytical methods against morphological identifications and additional methods (e.g. BINs, GMYC, PTP), using a new planktonic marine maxillopod reference data set covering a wide geographic range from Canada’s three oceans. Our results indicate the presence of a biologically significant COI threshold value of approximately 2.3 percent p-distance for maxillopods, which typically yields molecular groupings that are largely concordant with traditionally identified species. \nSignificance\nWe provide evidence in support of a general intra/interspecific COI threshold value for the marine maxillopods, which will help to facilitate rapid analysis of biodiversity data for biodiversity research and species discovery purposes. We further highlight taxa where there was less concordance between morphological and molecular delineations and recommend the need for continued biological research and the use of additional molecular markers to determine the diversity, distributions, and niches of species within these groups.</string>
    <string name="id378">Presenting Author: Aguilar-Velasco, R. Gabriela\n\nContact: supernatural_fairy@hotmail.com\n\nAuthors: R. Gabriela Aguilar-Velasco, Chantal Poteaux-Leonard, Alejandro Zaldívar-Riverón\n\nAbstract:\nNuclear mitochondrial paralogs (numts) are non-functional fragments of mtDNA integrated into the nuclear genome that can be coamplified through amplification of conserved primers, and their inclusion can overestimate the number of species in analyses based on mtDNA sequence data. Since numts have relatively slow mutation rates, they can pass undetected by conventional procedures such as inspecting for internal stop codons, indels, or apparent polymorphism in chromatograms. Species boundaries based on the mt locus therefore require a thorough assessment of numts, but especially in insects, where this phenomenon is more frequent. Ectatomma ruidum is a widely distributed Neotropical ant species that occurs from central Mexico to northern Brazil. Due to its considerable external morphological variation and close morphological similarity with other related species, the species boundaries within E. ruidum need to be thoroughly investigated. Here we assessed the species boundries in this taxon based on specimens collected from a number of localities along the Neotropics. We examined external morphology and sequences belonging to two mt (COI, cytochrome b) and one nuclear (H3) markers. Ancient and recent mt paralogs were detected in several specimens, though pre-PCR dilution of DNA template helped to recover most of the orthologs. There was extensive variation in the barcoding locus among samples, which precluded the use of BINs. Based on the congruence found between our species delineation analyses and the morphospecies identified, we propose that E. ruidum is actually composed of at least three evolutionary units, two of which have wide geographic distributions along the Neotropics. The evidence obtained from the nuclear marker also suggests the existence of hybrids between two of these species in southeast Mexico. This study agrees with previous studies of other animal taxa, which have revealed a complex evolutionary history and overlooked species diversity along the Mexican Pacific coast.</string>
    <string name="id468">Presenting Author: Jeffery, Nicholas\n\nContact: nick.w.jeffery3@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Nicholas Jeffery, T. Ryan Gregory, Sarah J. Adamowicz, Jonathan D.S. Witt\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nFreshwater amphipods of the genus Hyalella show remarkable genetic diversity in both North and South America. There are an estimated 100 “species” in North America based on COI sequence variability when applying a 5 percent divergence threshold, and more than 50 species within 2 subgenera in South America. Both of these species groups show their highest diversity in different hotspots, namely the Great Basin of the western United States and Lake Titicaca on the border of Peru and Bolivia. Here, we reinvestigate the diversity of Hyalella using DNA barcoding (COI analysis) and phylogenetic reconstruction using 28S nuclear sequences, coupled with genome size estimation of representatives from each major lineage. Genome size, defined as the total DNA content of the haploid chromosome set, is known to vary approximately 700-fold within crustaceans overall. Divergence in genome size can be associated with speciation, either through gradual changes in genome size, particularly in allopatric populations, or through rapid shifts via polyploidy, which can lead to sympatric speciation. \nResults\nWe found that genome size varies 4-fold within both North and South American Hyalella. Upon phylogenetic mapping of genome sizes and seeking lineages with doubled genome sizes, we find evidence for potential polyploidy in at least one case among the North America lineages. Genome size also varied up to 4-fold in the South American species, suggesting polyploidy, but the majority of lineages displayed more gradual genome size evolution. Phylogenetic conservatism of genome size is apparent, with Pagel’s λ ranging from 0.68-0.94 and differing significantly from a phylogeny with no signal. \nSignificance\nThese results suggest changes in genome size may have played a role in sympatric and allopatric diversification within Hyalella, while further study is needed using karyotypes to determine the extent of polyploidy. This study also reinforces the value of DNA barcoding as a useful tool to study cryptic diversity while coupling it with research that aims to understand the mechanisms behind the speciation process.</string>

Hebert, Juan Hernández-Roldán, Emily Hornett, Vladimir Lukhtanov, František Marec\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThere is a widely recognized need for more comprehensive understanding of global biodiversity patterns. Such information will not only provide insights into major scientific issues, such as speciation mechanisms, but it will also add new rigor to conservation programs (a critical need given the looming extinction crisis). We exploit the power of DNA barcoding to explore biodiversity patterns in European butterflies, one of the best-studied invertebrate groups in the world. Ongoing research allowed the detection of unexpected genetic patterns (exemplified here by Leptidea and Spialia), illustrating the biological complexity that awaits discovery even in exhaustively studied regions. \nResults\nThe intensively studied model species pair Leptidea sinapis and Leptidea reali has recently been shown to actually represent a triplet of species displaying genetic differences and reproductive isolation due to female mate choice. Additional research has shown that L. sinapis is currently the metazoan with the highest intraspecific chromosome number variability unrelated to polyploidy (2n=56 to 2n=110) and that its chromosomal races seem to follow a longitudinally-oriented cline. This unique system prompted us to test the role of chromosomal rearrangements in speciation and the concept of clinal species by mating extreme chromosomal races based on laboratory lines of L. sinapis. Within the genus Spialia, recent research stimulated by DNA barcodes suggests the presence of a new cryptic species confined to Iberia that has likely speciated through a shift in larval host-plant. Complex patterns of Wolbachia infections have been detected in both Leptidea and Spialia. \nSignificance\nLeptidea and Spialia represent some of the most striking cases of cryptic species in European butterflies. These taxa exemplify the effort that lies ahead when documenting biodiversity and show how patterns detected by DNA barcodes can lead to the discovery of exciting systems that can often act as models to improve our understanding of fundamental evolutionary processes.</string>

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technology (e.g., Illumina MiSeq) can recover detailed measures of the biodiversity of a wetland rapidly, accurately, and at a much lower cost per sample compared to morphological analysis. We have used environmental DNA barcoding to assess the biodiversity contained within mixed environmental samples collected in the boreal forest region of Canada. Each HTS sequencing run generates over a million DNA sequences from the organisms contained in each sample. DNA barcodes have been chosen to provide taxonomic coverage for each kingdom of life, including bacteria, plants, fungi, and animals. Bioinformatic processing of DNA sequence data recovers both taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity information about the organisms whose DNA is present in the sample. \nResults\nOur processing of multiple, mixed environmental samples from two river systems in Wood Buffalo National Park produced millions of DNA barcode sequences. Comparison of these sequences to public barcode libraries generated taxonomic lists for each sample up to and including species-level identification. Advanced alpha and beta diversity metrics were then generated based on these data. \nSignificance\nAll of the standard biomonitoring metrics employed by current practitioners can be replicated using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The recovery of genus- and species-level data greatly increases the resolution of the biodiversity assessment. By facilitating greater biodiversity recovery in a shorter time, DNA-based massively-parallel sequencing approaches will greatly multiply the force of human impact on assessing, and improving, the status of pristine and impacted wetlands.</string>
    <string name="id256">Presenting Author: Deiner, Kristy\n\nContact: alpinedna@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Kristy Deiner, Florian Altermatt\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nRiver channel restoration is used in water management to restore biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Recovery, however, is often context dependent and intrinsically linked to whether or not species occur locally and can recolonize a restored area. Determining the local species pool from a river’s catchment is therefore necessary in order to predict potential recovery. In river systems, the power of using environmental DNA (eDNA) to estimate the biodiversity of animals is just starting to be explored. It is known that eDNA of individual species can be transported downstream. Thus, water samples from rivers are likely to be an integrated measure of aquatic biodiversity for a river’s catchment. \nResults\nIn this study we used next-generation sequencing of the animal cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode from eDNA to describe metazoan eukaryotes across 24 catchments in Switzerland. We found over 10,000 molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) across the catchments, and these MOTUs can be assigned to nearly 20 animal phyla (e.g., Annelida, Arthropoda, Chordata, Heterokontophyta, and Mollusca). Additionally, terrestrial and riparian taxa, such as birds and spiders, were detected. Together, these results validate that eDNA can be used to biomonitor the animal kingdom living in or near freshwater resources and provide evidence that it does so on a scale relevant to the catchment of a watershed. \nSignificance\nBy combining the COI barcode for the animal kingdom and environmental DNA detection of species, we demonstrate how to assess species pools in river catchments. A biodiversity assessment tool such as this has the potential to inform restoration efforts about recolonization potential and become a powerful tool for landscape biodiversity assessments.</string>

Gibson, Carlos Lopez\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nForest ecosystems host most of the terrestrial biodiversity on Earth. Climate change scenarios predict an increase in the intensity and frequency of severe summer droughts, high temperatures, and infestations of pathogens and insects, causing high mortality of some keystone tree species. These changes will affect forestry policies and practices, strongly impacting biodiversity. Understanding the responses of biodiversity to forest decline is therefore essential to developing new climate-smart management options. Biomonitoring of forest insects relies on techniques involving laborious and expensive sampling procedures. For instance, the study of indicators such as saproxylic beetles is strongly impeded by their high abundance and diversity, and by the deficit in taxonomists able to identify them. Here, we propose and test the use of metabarcoding for bulk samples of saproxylic beetles, in combination with the assembly of a relevant barcode reference library, as a mean to streamline identification. \nResults\nUsing a set of three primer pairs targeting short fragments within the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) barcode, we analyzed through metabarcoding a set of 32 bulk samples of saproxylic beetles collected in France, containing hundreds of specimens that were all initially counted and identified using morphology. To test the efficiency of non-destructive analyses, we also sequenced libraries of amplicons directly obtained from the ethanol used for preserving the samples. Identifying the resulting reads with a newly assembled barcode library, we successfully recovered most species present in each of the samples. Furthermore, our samples were selected to take into account a variety of conditions and parameters possibly affecting the results (species diversity, relative abundance and biomass, sampling medium, and preservation method). \nSignificance\nThe use of DNA metabarcoding to monitor forest biodiversity can significantly improve our capacity to measure, understand, and anticipate the impact of global changes on forests, thus enhancing conservation strategies and the sustainability of silvicultural practices.</string>

Naaum, Lauren Overdyk, Steve Crawford, Robert Hanner\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nFish entrainment is a significant concern in power plants that employ open water cooling systems. In order to assess environmental impacts, the species-level identification of entrained specimens is necessary. However, entrained fish collected for identification are often damaged or degraded to the point that they can be challenging to identify. Importantly, eggs and larvae can be very difficult to identify using morphological means—even when fully intact—due to their small size and the limited availability of diagnostic keys. Therefore, identification of entrained material can be costly and time-consuming, as well as potentially inaccurate or impossible if samples are small and badly damaged. DNA-based analysis can be used to address these issues and provides an opportunity for improving the unidentified fraction of entrained fish specimens. \nResults\nA standardized protocol for collection, preservation, and extraction of DNA from larval fish and eggs has been developed. DNA barcoding was successful in improving species identification from fish larvae and eggs. Since entrainment samples are often mixed, real-time PCR assays for key species were developed to identify target species from entrainment mixtures. \nSignificance\nDNA barcoding can improve identification when added to existing methods for identifying entrained specimens. Real-time PCR allows direct monitoring of species of economic or environmental concern from mixed entrainment samples. This method can be used to track invasive or endangered species, and potentially quantitate their biomass as a percentage of entrained biological material. Both DNA barcoding and real-time PCR provide means to improve the accuracy and reliability with which entrainment studies are carried out. This allows companies to adhere to environmental legislation, and also provides better tools for biodiversity assessment.</string>

Morton, Sarah Meierotto\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nRapid climate change may result in ecological futures with novel species assemblages, trophic mismatch, and mass extinction. Conventional inventory and monitoring approaches are generally not designed to address these changes, particularly at the landscape scales needed to address climate change. On the 804,000-ha Kenai National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, we collaborated with the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis Program to inventory plants, landbirds, and arthropods on a grid of 259 permanent plots systematically distributed at 5-km intervals in 2004‒2008 (t1), yielding 1,106 species: 80 birds, 256 invertebrates, 324 vascular plants, 297 lichens, and 149 bryophytes. In preparation for t2 of a time series, we are building a library of DNA barcode sequences to facilitate monitoring of arthropods and other hyperdiverse groups (e.g., lichens) using next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods. Initial library construction included specimens from the grid (t1) and additional local sampling. Regionally, we have been building a DNA barcode library from material at the University of Alaska Museum. Real-world tests of the usefulness of the library for species identifications were performed using Sanger sequencing and NGS methods. \nResults\nOf the 8,421 species in the Draft Checklist of the Nonmarine Arthropods of Alaska, 4,020 (47 percent) are now represented on the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD), including 1,138 species that we contributed. We obtained species identifications for 17 percent of 950 Sanger-sequenced unknowns. Three NGS samples yielded 21‒48 named taxa per sample, of which 9‒17 were species identifications. \nSignificance\nOur approach provides a statistically robust spatial framework for landscape monitoring, allowing us to make inferences at multiple spatial scales while ensuring the capacity to detect ecological surprises that may result from a rapidly warming climate. With continuing improvements in NGS technology and dropping costs, we are setting the stage to deploy NGS methods for rapid and efficient biomonitoring at the landscape scale in 2016.</string>

Traditional monitoring is based on morphotaxonomic inventories of biological communities, which are time-consuming, expensive, and require excellent taxonomic expertise. High-throughput sequencing of environmental DNA (metabarcoding) offers a powerful tool to describe biodiversity. However, the capacity of the metabarcoding approach to meet the quality standards of bioindication is a subject of controversy. Here, we present the comparison of biotic indices inferred from morphotaxonomic and molecular data for different groups of bioindicators (diatoms, oligochaetes, meiofauna). We found that the molecular data faithfully reflected the morphology-based indices and provide a similar assessment of ecosystem status. We advocate that future biomonitoring should integrate metabarcoding as a rapid and accurate tool for the evaluation of the biological quality of aquatic ecosystems.</string>

Commonly used DNA extraction protocols involve homogenizing the samples, leading to loss of either a part or the entire specimen’s body structure. Here we introduce non-destructive and inexpensive direct PCR protocols for barcoding of individual specimens and a source of community DNA for environmental barcoding using HTS without any physical disturbance of the specimen. We also evaluate the amplification efficiency of a wide amplicon size range of both mitochondrial and nuclear markers. \nResult\nOur results indicate the efficiency of a direct PCR approach in recovering sequence data from hundreds of individual arthropod specimens from the Área de Conservación Guanacaste (ACG), Costa Rica, as well as five bulk benthos and five malaise trap samples from Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada. Our non-destructive protocols were effective in providing genomic template DNA for both mitochondrial and nuclear genes for specimen-based or bulk HTS analysis of biodiversity in a wide range of organisms. \nSignificance\nThe non-destructive, direct PCR approach presented here will avoid the labour-intensive DNA extraction procedure and its associated cost. Additionally, this approach will allow for rapid scanning of the contents of bulk eDNA samples for target taxa such as pathogens, vectors, and rare or endangered organisms. With this method, the morphological features of the vouchered specimens are well preserved for species identification, especially when dealing with a large number of small and fragile specimens.</string>

However, detection rates for species-rich stream invertebrate samples, as well as the capability to quantify biomass or species abundances, have not been systematically tested. We developed a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) metabarcoding protocol that uses the Illumina MiSeq platform and performed two controlled experiments (with 10 replicates each) using stream invertebrate samples. \nResults\nIn the first experiment we used 31 specimens of a single stonefly species that differed by up to four orders of magnitude in biomass. We found a clear biomass - sequence abundance relationship, but even the smallest specimens were reliably detected. In the second experiment, recovery of 52 different freshwater invertebrate taxa was tested using similar amounts of biomass per specimen as template. With a single universal primer pair we could recover 83 percent of the taxa. However, sequence abundance varied by four orders of magnitude between taxa. \nSignificance\nOur experiments show that although biomass can be estimated if only a single species is present in a sample, reliable species biomass or abundance estimates from environmental samples are impossible due to primer bias. Thus, DNA-based ecosystem assessments should rely on presence-absence rather than abundance data.</string>

In addition, the MinION device was used to sequence total genomic DNA and PCR amplicons from fresh and historical specimens—specifically hops, hemp, avocado, breadnut, and humans. \nSignificance\nThe entire chloroplast genome is an optimal DNA barcode for land plants. The ability to sequence long and short DNA fragments is useful to model DNA barcodes as well as to test the origins of plants and animals that are common, rare, or endemic. With low costs for high-throughput DNA sequencing, user-accommodating bioinformatics, and mobile hardware, the model presented here shows how to study long and short DNA barcodes with a nanopore sequencing approach. Thus, nanopore sequencing will transform interdisciplinary research on historical and contemporary biological collections, particularly testing the evolutionary relationships and species limits for cultivars and wild taxa with low genetic distance.

James\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nOxford Nanopore Technologies’ MinION™ device is a miniaturized platform for direct, electronic analysis of single molecules (DNA, RNA, protein, etc.). The MinION is a portable, self-contained, real-time instrument—about the size of a smartphone—that accepts reusable flow cells and connects directly to a laptop or desktop computer via USB. The device produces a “wiggle plot” which is uploaded to the cloud for real-time base-calling. The MinION Access Programme (MAP) is a pre-commercial beta-testing program in which several hundred participants have been invited to apply the MinION to a range of biological questions and research contexts. \nResults\nAs MAP participants, we used the MinION to sequence PCR-amplified DNA from a broad range of individual animal and plant specimens from Acadia National Park and from mitochondrial and chloroplast-enriched genomic DNA from mixed environmental samples, including invasive green crab (Carcinus maenas) stomach contents and marine sediments associated with disrupted, healthy, and restored eelgrass (Zostera marina) habitat in Frenchman Bay, Maine. We will report the results of our initial experiments including total basepairs, read lengths, coverage of DNA barcode regions, raw wiggle plots, cloud-based base-called sequences, and results from comparison of base-called sequences with published animal and plant DNA barcode reference sequences using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) identification engine. \nSignificance\nFrom the moment DNA barcoding was proposed more than a decade ago, members of the DNA barcoding community have looked forward to a day when a handheld device might be used for DNA-based identification of organisms in the field, in real time.

However, taxonomic identification employing current methodologies is very time-consuming, technically difficult, and frequently does not provide species-level data. Although metabarcoding approaches have been tested and successfully implemented on freshwater macrobenthos, no homologous approaches have been proposed and tested for estuarine and marine macrobenthic communities, which are particularly challenging due to their much greater phylogenetic diversity. \nResults\nTo investigate the ability to successfully amplify a fragment of the DNA barcode region (658 bp of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I mtDNA gene - COI-5P) from all species present in a whole-community DNA extract, we assembled 3 phylogenetically diverse, simulated communities (SCs) with a different number of species (9 to 36) and specimens per species (9 to 67). Four distinct primer combinations were used to amplify COI barcode fragments from DNA isolates of each of the SCs, and the respective PCR products were sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq platform. Approximately 80 percent of the species present in the 3 SCs were recovered after analyses of the MiSeq-generated sequences. Notably, this recovery rate was attained using only two primer combinations. Subsequently, we compared morphology and metabarcoding-based approaches to determine the species composition of macrobenthos from 4 different collection sites of the Sado estuary, Portugal. In each site, 5 sediment replicates were used separately for morphology- and metabarcoding-based identifications. As expected, polychaete annelids were the dominant component of the macrobenthic community in this estuarine ecosystem. \nSignificance\nThese promising results indicate the viability of metabarcoding approaches for implementation in biodiversity assessments of estuarine macrobenthic communities. Further developments are required including the completion of the DNA barcode reference library for marine and estuarine macrobenthos and improvements in recovery rates.</string>

Brian Golding, Mehrdad Hajibabaei\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAlthough the use of metagenomic methods to sample below-ground fungal communities is common, the use of similar methods to sample plants from their underground structures is not. In this study we use the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (rbcL) plastid marker to sample the plant community as well as the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) markers to sample the fungal community from two wetland sites. \nResults\nObserved community richness and composition varied by marker. The two rDNA markers detected complementary sets of fungal taxa. The taxonomic composition of fungi sampled across sites, but produced by the same primer, was more similar to each other than with fungi sampled from the same site. By contrast, the taxonomic composition of the most frequently sampled rbcL OTUs was most similar within sites. \nSignificance\nWe suggest that future studies consider using multiple markers—ideally generated from different primer sets—to detect a more taxonomically diverse suite of taxa compared with what can be detected by any single marker used alone. Conclusions drawn from the presence of even the most frequently observed taxa should be made with caution without corroborating lines of evidence.</string>
    <string name="id553">Presenting Author: Hobern, Donald\n\nContact: dhobern@gbif.org\n\nAuthors: Donald Hobern\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nModern society and global science increasingly rely on integration of massive quantities of data to answer questions and guide planning. Many areas of human activity impact and are impacted by biodiversity, yet it remains difficult to address these impacts within models. A significant proportion of human knowledge of the world\'s biota remains locked up in printed formats or distributed among the world\'s natural history collections. \nResults\nA range of international biodiversity informatics organizations are working to deliver digital representations of this historical knowledge and to integrate it with contemporary data streams. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF, http://www.gbif.org/) focuses on standardized evidence for the recorded occurrence of any species at any time and place. The Catalogue of Life (CoL, http://catalogueoflife.org/) seeks to construct a comprehensive catalogue of described species and their names. The Biodiversity Heritage Library (BHL, http://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/) is bringing the historical literature online. The Encyclopedia of Life (EOL, http://www.eol.org/) aims to integrate structured data representing the properties and traits of species. However, these activities remain only loosely linked with major biomolecular databasing activities. \nSignificance\nThe barcoding community, and the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) database in particular, forms a bridge between the world of specimens and collections and the world of sequences. Closer collaboration between BOLD and these other biodiversity informatics activities offers the opportunity to fuse historical knowledge with large-scale DNA-based biodiversity monitoring to deliver the most accurate perspective possible on biodiversity patterns and trends. Cooperation and planning now could deliver the infrastructure to move from a legacy of primarily paper-based knowledge to a stable digital knowledgebase which will be enhanced and enriched by all new data, simultaneously facilitating future research in taxonomy and biogeography and supporting the pressing need for up-to-date knowledge to support conservation and wider sustainability goals.</string>
    <string name="id374">Presenting Author: Ma, Eddie\n\nContact: ema@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Eddie Ma, Sujeevan Ratnasingham\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nA DNA barcode sequence can be thought of as a query into a sequence database for a matching species of life. The traditional method to perform this query is BLASTN, but this and other alignment scoring methods come with the limitation that higher levels of Linnaean taxonomy are ignored. Recovering this taxonomy is deceptively difficult as mutation of the sites within the COI-5P barcode region is saturated. This implies that sequence similarity cannot be used as a reliable measure of the evolutionary distance between species when they are of different orders. Here, we present an alternative to alignment methods, which takes advantage of an extracted feature space occupied by DNA barcodes to perform queries at the order level. \nResult\nThis method was developed using the extracted features of nucleotide k-mer and amino acid composition statistics from 16k sequences. A final feature vector of 16 values is capable of correctly classifying 89.6 percent of sequences into the correct order using a nearest-neighbour search. \nSignificance\nRecovering the correct order of a query sequence adds an additional layer of verification for unidentified specimens. Furthermore, any additional taxonomical information can facilitate the analysis of the sequence and provide a way to reject an unexpected sequence before it enters alignment or phylogenetic analysis.</string>

On the one hand, traditional alignment-based methods are time-consuming and cannot be used for the analysis of non-alignable, multi-locus sequences. On the other hand, alignment-free algorithms allow for the establishment of similarity between biological sequences based on the counts of fixed-length substrings (k-mers) and have proved successful in many applications, including multi-locus DNA barcode analysis. Alignment-free algorithms rely on counting and comparing the frequency of all the distinct k-mers that occur in the considered sequences. \nResults\nHere, we present LAF (Logic Alignment Free), a method that combines alignment-free techniques and rule-based classifiers in order to assign multi-locus DNA barcode sequences to their corresponding species. LAF looks for a minimal subset of k-mers whose relative frequencies are used to build the classification models as disjunctive-normal-form logic formulas (“if-then rules” - e.g., “if the frequency of AACT>0.03, then the species of the sequence is Mycena pura”). \nSignificance\nWe successfully applied LAF to the classification of DNA barcode sequences belonging to the plant and fungus kingdoms. In particular, focusing our analysis on multi-locus barcode samples, we succeeded in obtaining reliable classification performances at different taxonomic levels by extracting a handful of rules.]]></string>

N. Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBiodiversity data are accumulating at an unprecedented rate. However, their scholarly publication often happens at the expense of tedious and time-consuming conversions that transform structured data into non-machine-readable and non-reusable formats, such as PDF and paper, thus adding to the ever-growing backlog of these types of data. This is a deeply inefficient process that has to change. Publication of biodiversity data needs to be fast, efficient, and structured. \nResults\nThe Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ) successfully tested several routes to export specimen and other data from the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) to BDJ’s authoring tool via APIs and/or Excel spreadsheets. The authoring tool allows authors to further elaborate manuscripts online in collaboration with co-authors and peers; for example, by providing specific epithets, concise morphological descriptions and diagnoses, type specimen data, and additional taxonomic remarks, to complete the formal publication in a way that meets the requirements of the codes of biological nomenclature. The final version of the manuscript is submitted to BDJ “at the click of a button” for further community peer-review, publication, and dissemination. On the very day of publication, BOLD can update its original records either through automated metadata export or by a harvesting mechanism. Occurrence records are automatically exported and indexed in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Data paper manuscripts describing barcode data sets—also known as “barcode data release” papers—can also be extracted from the metadata descriptors at BOLD and finalized in BDJ’s authoring tool. \nSignificance\nData are imported into manuscripts and published in both human-readable text and structured Darwin Core formats that can be downloaded by humans, or harvested by computers straight from the journal article. This workflow saves a great deal of effort for all parties involved—authors, editors, future users, and data aggregators.</string>

It corresponds to the use of a single or few small portions of the genome (= standard barcodes) as a discrete taxonomic character for identifying unknown specimens by comparison with a reference database. The barcoding initiative was very successful and led to the collaboration of many teams around the world, producing extensive reference databases. However, the standard barcodes were designed in the context of Sanger sequencing, and the recent development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows further developments of the barcoding initiative. In light of the PhyloAlps project aiming to sequence the whole alpine flora, we suggest to complement the standard barcode strategy with an approach taking advantage of the power of NGS. We propose to develop an extended barcode, simply composed of one or two gigabases of sequence reads obtained using shotgun sequencing of genomic DNA. From this extended barcode, we demonstrate for both an animal dataset and for a plant dataset that it is possible to extract the initial standard barcodes, the whole organelle genomes, the whole nuclear ribosomal tandem repeats, and a collection of sequence reads corresponding to single-copy DNA regions. Such an extended barcode can be generated not only for multicellular eukaryotes, but also for microorganisms via single-cell sequencing. As a consequence, the extended barcode has the potential of being truly universal, encompassing organisms from the three domains of life (eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea). After a four-year sampling effort, the PhyloAlps 6,000-sequence dataset will be produced by the end of 2015 at Genoscope in France. This tremendous dataset can be considered as a large pilot experiment for this new DNA barcoding strategy.</string>
    <string name="id310">Presenting Author: Markus Ankenbrand\n\nContact: markus.ankenbrand@uni-wuerzburg.de\n\nAuthors: Markus Ankenbrand, Alexander Keller, Matthias Wolf, Jörg Schultz, Frank Förster\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) is a well-established marker for DNA barcoding, especially for plants and fungi. Yet so far, no specific reference database exists dedicated to this purpose. Extracting ITS2 sequences for a taxonomic group from GenBank is tedious manual work, which is prone to errors due to misannotations. The same challenges also apply for phylogenetic analyses, for which we have already developed the ITS2-workbench. It provides structure-based annotations and quality control for sequences extracted from GenBank. Further, it offers tools for Hidden Markov Models (HMM) annotation, secondary structure prediction, alignment, and tree calculation. However, it lacked the ability to taxonomically classify barcode sequences with confidence estimations. \nResults\nHere, we present an extension of the ITS2-workbench for the application in DNA barcoding. It is based on the underlying data of 700,000 quality-controlled sequences from more than 175,000 species (2015 update). This includes approximately 80,000 distinct species for plants and fungi, each. Additionally, other eukaryotic groups that have been so far less represented in barcoding studies are covered (e.g., the class Bacillariophyceae). The workbench uses UTAX as the classifier, which allows for barcoding of user-provided sequences and provides confidence values for each taxonomic rank. For smaller data sets the results can be immediately viewed on the website. For large data sets (e.g., next-generation sequencing amplicon data), the user is notified by email as soon as the download of the classification results is ready. \nSignificance\nThe combination of a huge amount of quality-controlled ITS2 sequences with the powerful classification algorithm UTAX facilitates the broad usage of ITS2 as a DNA barcode. The integration into the ITS2-workbench provides the means to also use the rich phylogenetic methods and supplementary reference sequences for further analyses.

However, COI plays a critical part in the cellular respiratory chain, and the barcode fragment is located in the enzymatically active part of the COI protein. Thus, changes in the amino acid sequence and protein structure may affect energy metabolism. The massive number of sequences generated by barcode initiatives around the globe allows us to explore the evolution of this core metabolic enzyme in an unprecedented scale. We study amino acid variation and evolution of COI protein structure in a crosscut of the entire Metazoa, and in denser samples of two megadiverse insect orders, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. \nResults\nThe COI barcode region covers 219 amino acids: 23 were conserved across the entire Metazoa, while 99 were highly variable. Based on 3D models of the protein, six of these variable amino acids were located at atomic interaction distance from the heme ligands, potentially affecting enzyme function. Deletions were uncommon, and the vast majority of them were found in parasites representing several different phyla. Unrelated parasite taxa also exhibited some convergent amino acid changes at the heme-facing variable sites. Coleoptera showed more amino acid variation than Lepidoptera (39 vs 14 highly variable sites, respectively). Variation at sites potentially affecting enzymatic activity was concentrated on a handful of herbivorous and ancestrally fungivorous beetle lineages. \nSignificance\nPatterns of COI barcode variation have rarely (if ever) been studied from the perspective of protein function and evolution. As expected, the protein structure is generally conserved, but we managed to uncover some interesting exceptions. Convergent evolution in parasites is particularly interesting and possibly connected to similar hostile conditions faced by endoparasites inside their hosts. The usefulness of large-scale barcode libraries extends beyond identification and taxonomy.</string>
    <string name="id516">Presenting Author: Young, Monica R\n\nContact: myoung02@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Monica R. Young, Paul D. N. Hebert\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBroad patterns of mitochondrial evolution have seen little investigation in Arachnida. Because sequence information is now available for the 648bp barcode region of COI from nearly 400,000 animal species, this gene segment can be used to probe patterns of mitochondrial evolution. The present study examines levels of amino acid substitution and the frequency of indels in COI from 4177 species of arachnids, including representatives from all 16 orders and 43 percent of its families (267/625). \nResults\nDivergences were examined at three taxonomic levels. Order Distances vary fourfold (0.10–0.39), while the mean of the Family Distances for each order ranges fivefold (0.07–0.35). BIN Distances show great variation, ranging from 0.01 or less in 12 families to more than 0.25 in eight families. Groups whose COI genes have elevated levels of amino acid substitution also regularly possess indels, and these rates are negatively correlated with generation times. Patterns of amino acid substitution in COI are generally congruent with previously reported variation in nucleotide substitution rates in arachnids, but provide some new insights, such as clear rate acceleration in the Opiliones. \nSignificance\nBy revealing a strong association between elevated rates of nucleotide and amino acid substitution, this study builds evidence for the selective importance of the rate variation among arachnid lineages. Overall, this study suggests that the mitochondrial genome of some arachnid groups is dynamic with high rates of amino acid substitution and frequent indels, while it is ‘locked down’ in others. Dynamic genomes are most prevalent in arachnids with short generation times, but the possible impact of breeding system deserves investigation since many of the rapidly evolving lineages reproduce by haplodiploidy, a mode of reproduction absent in ‘locked down’ taxa.</string>

Adamowicz\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe molecular clock remains an invaluable tool yet a controversial topic in evolutionary biology. The opening/reclosure of the Bering Strait provides a calibration point to estimate molecular divergence rates in northern marine taxa. Building upon a small number of prior studies, on polychaetes and starfish, we explore patterns of molecular divergence in eight sister pairs of echinoderms inhabiting the Pacific vs. Arctic-Atlantic coast of North America. Genetic divergences (Kimura 2-parameter) were estimated between 8 trans-barrier sister pairs of echinoderms, using publicly available cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) sequences and with phylogenetic relationships verified using whole-genus analysis when possible. To be consistent with previous studies, we used a maximum time of divergence of 3.5 million years (MY) to calibrate a molecular clock, as this represents the approximate timing of the first major trans-Arctic interchange. \nResults\nK2P divergences between Arctic-Atlantic and Pacific sister clades ranged from 2.9–18.5 percent. Assuming simultaneous isolation of all trans-Arctic pairs, these results would imply high variation in evolutionary rates. Another possible scenario is that sister clades migrated through the Bering Strait on separate occasions, which is supported by clusters of divergence values within this large overall range. In order to compare with prior polychaete research, we therefore used the consistent cluster of points to calculate a preliminary average divergence rate of 4.5 percent/MY. \nSignificance\nInterestingly, our results mirror those previously found for polychaetes, suggesting both multiple pulses of trans-Bering migration as well as apparently high rates of molecular evolution in Arctic invertebrates (4.5 percent divergence/MY in echinoderms vs. 4.4 percent in polychaetes). Future work will include testing for rate variability, increasing the sample size of pairs, and considering the full range of possible trans-Bering migration times, with the goal of providing more realistic ranges of potential rates for comparison with tropical rates calibrated using the Isthmus of Panama.</string>
    <string name="id125">Presenting Author: Braukmann, Thomas\n\nContact: tbraukmann@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Thomas Braukmann, Sasa Stefanovic\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAbout 1 percent of flowering plants have lost all or some of their photosynthetic ability. These heterotrophic plants rely entirely or partially on a host to supply water and nutrients. Heterotrophic plants are divided into two distinct groups: haustorial parasites and mycoheterotrophs. Haustorial parasitism has evolved at least 11 times independently, and mycoheterotrophy has at least 10 independent origins in angiosperms. Ericaceae, the heather family, is a large and diverse group of plants with elaborate symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, including several mycoheterotrophic lineages. \nResults\nWe investigated the evolution of mycoheterotrophy in Ericaceae, using select sampling across the trophic spectrum and a next-generation sequencing approach, including multiple representatives from the partially mycoheterotrophic pyroloids and fully mycoheterotrophic monotropoids. Our results indicate that rearrangements of the large single copy region of the plastome, as well as expansion and contractions to the inverted repeat regions, are typical for most members of Ericaceae. Associated with the extensive structural rearrangements of the plastome within the family, including fully mycoheterotrophic species, is an increase in forward and palindromic repeats. Additionally, most Ericaceae share the loss of the plastid ycf1, ycf2, and clpP genes, which is rare even amongst fully heterotrophic plant lineages. \nSignificance\nConsistent with other heterotrophic lineages, hemi-mycoheterotrophic plants retain most genes relating to photosynthesis but are polymorphic for the presence of the plastid \'ndh’ genes, and the monotropoids exhibit extreme reductions in plastome size and gene content. Surprisingly, a number of different genes were found to be under positive selection in both partially and fully mycoheterotrophic species. We also discuss the limitations of plastid based markers and whole plastome data for DNA barcoding.</string>

Adamowicz, Xin Zhou\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe gain and loss of flight in animals is associated with increased rates of molecular evolution in mitochondrial genes, likely due to positive or relaxed selection related to energy usage. Previous observations have associated flight loss in insects with increased molecular rates in cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Recently, the gain of flight in insects has been investigated for positive selection in mitochondrial protein-coding genes. We expand on previous studies, by using the newest transcriptome-based insect topology and more complete sampling of apterygote hexapods, to explore positive selection in the lineage in which flight likely evolved. We include all mitochondrial protein-coding genes and over 900 nuclear protein-coding genes for 27 hexapod species. Through inclusion of non-energy related genes, we can help to clarify whether elevated rates reflect genome-wide patterns or are specifically linked to selection related to energy demands. We furthermore specifically investigate positive selection in mitochondrial and nuclear oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes, including COI, across all 32 hexapod orders. \nResults\nAlthough COI or other mitochondrial or nuclear OXPHOS genes themselves do not show a strong signal of positive selection associated with the origin of Pterygota, categories of nuclear genes related to the mitochondrion are found to be significantly often under positive selection in the lineage where flight originated. \nSignificance\nThis study is the first exploration of positive selection in this particular lineage using a phylogenetic approach and with the largest gene representation to date for apterygote hexapods. A synthesis of evidence across evolutionarily disparate instances of flight gain in animals reveals parallel molecular evolutionary patterns in energy-related genes.</string>

However, the underlying evolutionary mechanisms are unknown. Here we utilize human data to evaluate alternative models—bottlenecks vs purifying selection. Humans are an ideal test case because we are vastly better studied than any other animal in terms of genetic diversity and evolutionary history. Human mtDNA diversity is understood to reflect our recent evolutionary origin and subsequent population expansion, but it is not known whether humans are an exception among animals. We analyzed 9,413 human mitogenomes in public databases representing all major haplogroups and compared human mitogenome variation to that of our closest living and extinct relatives (i.e., chimpanzees and bonobos, and Neanderthals and Denosovians, respectively) and to that other animals as recorded in mitogenome and COI barcode libraries. \nResults\nWe found that human COI variation is representative of the coding mitogenome as a whole and is typical of that in large surveys of other animals, including birds (548 species), fish (684 species), and moths (754 species). Unlike humans, chimpanzees and bonobos have distinct mitochondrial clusters associated with subspecies or regional populations. Most (70 percent) synonymous codons in the human mitogenome differed among one or more apparently healthy individuals and variants were randomly distributed, findings inconsistent with a purifying selection model. \nSignificance\nHuman mtDNA diversity typifies that of the majority of other animals which have single mtDNA clusters. Our results support similarly recent adaptive bottlenecks as underlying intraspecific mtDNA clustering in humans and most other animals. We propose that most extant animals, like humans, are population outgrowths of recently evolved species.</string>

Investigating biological community responses to past anthropogenic disturbances is essential to understand and anticipate long-term biodiversity changes. Over time, lake sediments accumulate physical, chemical, and biological material - including DNA - from the surrounding terrestrial environment through erosion and sedimentation. Taking advantage of the promises of environmental DNA metabarcoding to describe biodiversity, we investigated historic changes in biodiversity in response to human-induced environmental modifications around a high-elevation lake over the last 10000 years. More specifically, we (i) investigated the main past anthropogenic disturbances (i.e. pastoral activities) in this mountainous area by tracking mammal DNA in the sediment records, (ii) reconstructed vegetation trajectories by targeting plant DNA, and (iii) evaluated the relative impact of these human activities vs climate variations on plant biodiversity. \nResults\nOur high-quality data allowed reliable inference about presence/absence patterns of numerous taxa along the chronological record of DNA in the sediments. First, we detected the presence of livestock farming (cattle and/or sheep) associated with increased erosion during the Roman Period and Middle Age. Second, we reconstructed plant community dynamics from DNA. We particularly identified an abrupt replacement of mountain forests and tall-herb communities by heathlands and grazed lands ~4500 years ago. Plant community trajectories over the Holocene were mostly related to soil evolution and pastoral activities, highlighting the predominance of anthropogenic factors for their long-term evolution. All these results corroborated with the known anthropogenic history of the studied area. \nSignificance\nSedimentary ancient DNA hence provides reliable information on past biodiversity changes in relation to human activities. This approach opens new avenues for research in paleoecology. It will also enable the enhancement of forecasting models of species distributions and biodiversity loss by giving access to biodiversity records on temporal scales that were heretofore inaccessible.</string>

Yet, in urban areas, bees retain important ecosystem services, e.g., pollination of garden plants that can provide food for other animals. Furthermore, biodiversity in urban ecosystems can enhance human well-being and is important from a societal point of view - personal exposure to “nature” in everyday life is a major determinant of sensitivity to environmental issues and people\'s views on natural ecosystems. Without an understanding of the diversity of bees in urbanisation hotspots we cannot predict how future development will affect ecosystem functions provided by bees. At the same time, basic information regarding perspectives of Southeast Asia’s urban community towards bees is essential for any regional plan. Our first objective was to investigate the species richness and abundance of bees in four megacities in Southeast Asia – Greater Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur (Klang Valley), Pearl River Delta (Hong Kong/Shenzhen), Singapore (Singapore/Iskandar Malaysia) - and their distribution from suburbs, through ornamental gardens, to central business districts. Our second objective was to determine perspectives of the urban community regarding the presence of bees in urban areas. \nResults\nWe conducted bee sampling and interviewed locals at sites in the suburbs, ornamental gardens, and central business districts. We used DNA barcoding to assess the species richness and abundance at the sites. Preliminary analyses suggest species richness declined from the suburbs to the central business district; however, a few species were found in high abundance in central business districts. Surprisingly, the presence of bees is largely unnoticed by the human residents. \nSignificance\nThis is the first regional study of bee diversity in urban Southeast Asia and is unique in also examining human perceptions. Education programs are necessary to challenge both the generally negative perceptions towards bees and make urban areas more bee friendly.</string>

Studies of urban ecology have suggested city parks can be effective refuges for wildlife in temperate regions, but their effectiveness as refuges for wildlife in tropical regions is unknown. We examined the species diversity of butterflies in city parks in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and investigated the relationships between butterfly species richness and three park variables: i) park age; ii) park size; and iii) distance from the central business district. Standardised butterfly sampling was conducted across different microhabitat types at each park: i) groves; ii) hedges; iii) flowerbeds; and iv) unmanaged. We collected 572 butterflies belonging to 60 species from five families. 97 percent of species were considered common. Species richness was positively correlated with park age and size and negatively correlated with distance from the central business district; however, the correlations were weak and not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The highest richness (65 percent of observed species) was recorded in the unmanaged microhabitats. It is likely that both park planting scheme and the presence of early-successional plants in unmanaged microhabitats contribute to the stongest pattern observed, which was highest butterfly species richness in parks containing all the four microhabitat types. Whether a diverse planting scheme and increased size and number of unmanaged areas in parks can improve the ability of parks to sustain populations of rare butterflies in the face of other urban landscape parameters remains to be seen.]]></string>

It is genetically diverse, and over 70 mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotypes have been sequenced to date. There is also considerable physiological variation among G. hodgsoni individuals in their cold tolerance and metabolic activity. Climate changes predicted for SVL are likely to result in glacial retreat and increased connectivity among populations. Here, we assessed COI haplotypes of G. hodgsoni relative to the environmental conditions during which individuals were active. We sequenced 151 individuals collected in pitfall traps from three sites within Taylor Valley in January 2014. \nResults\nWe found 19 unique COI haplotypes that separated into two distinct groups (1.6 percent divergence), with one haplotype group comprising 80 percent of the sequenced population. Based upon sampling every two hours, air temperature was the strongest predictor of activity between the two haplotype groups (R2 = 0.56). Upon adding subsurface soil temperature, relative humidity, and photosynthetically active radiation, explanatory power increased to R2 = 0.71. \nSignificance\nWith steadily increasing air temperatures predicted for much of Antarctica, individuals with greater activity are likely to have greater dispersal opportunities. Accordingly, some haplotypes may have a selective advantage, which could result in decreased genetic variability within populations. We suggest that spatial and temporal monitoring of relative proportions of COI haplotypes may provide a subtle measure of biological response to environmental changes within Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.</string>

When collected from the wild, eggs from these species are lab cultured, resulting in a heterogeneous mixture of nymphs. H. limbata and H rigida are also morphologically cryptic at the toxicity testing stage (5 mg). Though differential abdominal pigmentation at the bioaccumulation testing stage (20–30mg) may help to morphologically distinguish each species, sorting individuals would require much time and effort. As such, an unknown ratio of each species is often used in ecotoxicological testing. Species-level responses to environmental perturbations, however, are quite common. In an effort to determine the ratio of H. rigida and H. limbata in a typical ecotoxicological bioassay, a standard 96-hour water-only toxicity test with a water-only control, carrier-solution control, and three different concentrations of PCB-52 was performed in which ten living individuals were randomly selected from each test vessel upon test completion and barcoded. \nResults\nAcross all five treatments, including the controls, there was an uneven distribution of H. rigida and H. limbata. The proportion of H. rigida across test vessels ranged from 20 percent to 90 percent. \nSignificance\nSpecies identification via DNA barcoding is important for determining possible species-level effects of environmental toxicant exposure across various levels of biological organization. Standard ecotoxicological test species, such as H. limbata and H. rigida, are often used as a mixture in conventional bioassays. Application of DNA barcoding techniques to identify the species used in these conventional bioassays will provide better data with which to make recommendations to stakeholders.</string>
    <string name="id470">Presenting Author: Eaton, William\n\nContact: weaton@pace.edu\n\nAuthors: William Eaton, Shadi Shokralla, Mehrdad Hajibabaei\n\nAbstract:\nBACKGROUND\nThe Franklin Parker Preserve within the Pine Barrens region of New Jersey contains 5,000 acres of wetlands habitat, including old growth red maple (Acer rubrum) swamps, cranberry bogs, and former cranberry bogs that have been restored with the goal of developing them into red maple forests. This provides excellent experimental conditions with which to test the efficacy of restoring cranberry bogs into old growth red maple forests, using changes in soil bacterial, fungal, and invertebrate communities and increases in efficiency of C utilization as indicators of restoration success. \nRESULTS\nIn this study, it was shown that the organic C, C biomass, and C-use efficiency were greater within old growth maple forest soils than in 8-year old restored red maple stands, which were greater than found in soil from 4-year old red maple stands—the latter two stands being restored from long-term cranberry bogs. A detailed metagenomic analysis of eDNA extracted from these soils showed that these C-cycle trends were clearly associated with increases in the relative numbers of DNA sequences from copiotrophic bacterial groups (e.g. specific representative groups from the Acidobacteria, Actinomycetales, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria), complex C-decomposing fungal groups (e.g. specific representatives groups from the Sordiomycetes, Mortierellales, and Thelephorales), and colembollan and formicid invertebrates. All these groups are indicators of successionally more advanced soils and are critical for soil C-cycle activities. \nSIGNIFICANCE\nThe restoration activities used at the Franklin Parker Reserve are enhancing critical guilds of soil biota and increasing C-use efficiency in the soils of restored habitats. The data from this study suggest the use of metagenomic analysis of eDNA from these soils can be used in the development of a predictive model for soil recovery of these wetlands following restoration. The Franklin Parker Reserve restoration strategies should be modeled by others with regulatory control over similar damaged wetlands.</string>

Knowledge of species composition in different parts of the world is also limited, and a significant number of species are synonyms. Antlions are generally a complex group to identify, and taxonomic expertise for their reliable identification is scarce. DNA barcoding is a useful tool for species discrimination, and development of reference DNA barcode libraries will enable future sequence-based identification of specimens to the species level. Pakistan, with its diverse but poorly explored antlion fauna, is an excellent target for such a study. \nResults\nAntlions were collected from different areas of Pakistan and identified to the species level using morphology. Of the 43 species we collected, 39 yielded successful barcode sequences from cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Analysis of the barcode data revealed that most of the species did not match closely (there was no match of >98 percent sequence similarity) with any records presently on the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) or GenBank, indicating either that the species are endemic to the region or have been poorly represented in DNA barcoding surveys conducted elsewhere. The intraspecific distances in all the species were lower than the distances to their nearest-neighbor species. Assignment of the morphologically identified species to unique Barcode Index Numbers supported the capability of barcode data for discrimination among antlion species. \nSignificance\nThis study begins construction of the first DNA barcode reference library for antlions of Pakistan. The availability of barcode data will help to solve taxonomic confusion and avoid overestimation of species numbers. The beneficial nature of antlions for biological control highlights the importance of their correct identification.]]></string>

Sequence variation in the mitochondrial COI-5ʹ gene region (DNA barcode) has proven effective for the identification of species of insect pests. \nResults\nWe analyzed barcode sequence variation among 471 thrips from various plant hosts in north-central Pakistan. The Barcode Index Number (BIN) system assigned these sequences to 55 BINs, a number similar to the partitions recognized by Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery. Sequence analysis revealed that intraspecific distances ranged from 0.0 percent to 7.5 percent, while congeneric species showed 5.6 percent to 27 percent divergence. Neighbour joining and bayesian inference trees supported the presence of 56 monophyletic lineages. Barcode sequences for three major pest and vector species (Haplothrips reuteri, Thrips palmi, and Thrips tabaci) and one predatory thrips (Aeolothrips intermedius) showed deep intraspecific divergences, strongly suggesting that each is a cryptic species complex. \nSignificance\nThis study compiles the first barcode reference library for the thrips of Pakistan and examines global haplotype diversity in four important pest thrips.</string>

In order to assist in their identification and to improve the taxonomy of this group, we constructed a reference dataset of 480 COI barcodes of 83 common nominal species from Ghana, Togo, Benin, and Nigeria (West Africa), and evaluated its identification accuracy with three methods (K2P distance-based, neighbour joining, and using SpeciesIdentifier). \nResults\nResults of the three methods were highly congruent and showed high identification success. Nine species pairs showed a low (< 3 percent) mean interspecific K2P distance, with several cases of paraphyly and misidentifications. A high (> 3 percent) mean intraspecific K2P distance was observed in eight species, with several cases of para/polyphyly that may indicate the occurrence of cryptic species. Optimal K2P thresholds to differentiate intra- from interspecific K2P divergence were highly different among the three subfamilies (Eristalinae: 3.5 percent; Syrphinae: 5.8 percent; Microdontinae: 0.7-2 percent). \nSignificance\nIn addition to providing an alternative identification tool, our study indicates that DNA barcoding improves the taxonomy of Afrotropical hover flies by highlighting groups of taxa that deserve further taxonomic study, and by identifying the unknown sex of species displaying sexual dimorphism. Expanding the reference database by including less-common species with poor taxonomic placement will prove challenging.]]></string>

Chambers\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBat guano is a relatively untapped reservoir of information, with great utility as a DNA source because it is abundant in caves and mines even when bats are not present, and it is stationary and easy to collect. Three technologies have come of age that, together, enable species identification from guano: reliable DNA typing from feces, DNA barcoding (species-specific genetic identifiers), and bioinformatic analysis. Taking advantage of these advances, we used 1.6 million sequences to develop a DNA mini-barcode assay that targets a segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, and that we have found to be highly discriminatory among Chiroptera globally, readily accommodates fecal DNA, and selectively targets bat but not prey DNA. \nResults\nOur assay has high resolution (93 percent) for barcoded bat species; we have successfully validated it from the feces of 25 bat species (e.g. identification of Myotis septentrionalis, Eptesicus fuscus, Corynorhinus townsendii) with aged fecal pellets (up to 3 months old) and individual and pooled guano pellets, such that questions can target individuals (using specific fecal pellets) or populations and communities (long-term roost sites). Another benefit of our Species from Feces tool is in confirming field identification, especially of morphologically similar species. In several instances, our genetic approach revealed misidentification of mist-netted species. We have developed a searchable website (http://nau.edu/CEFNS/Forestry/Research/Bats/Search-Tool/) that allows users to determine the discriminatory power of our markers for bat species that interest them. \nSignificance\nAlthough our Species from Feces tool has immediate application in the U.S., where bats are under threat from White-Nose Syndrome, it is also a potentially powerful application worldwide, for example, in determining the presence of bat species that are vulnerable or facing extinction.</string>

With the recent discovery of new species collected in various parts of the country, the number of known species increased to around 200. Our study attempts to infer the phylogenetic relationship among the members of Pheretima s.lat. in Mindanao Island, which includes 18 morphospecies, represented by Pheretima s.str. [including the two subgenera Pheretima (13 spp.) and Parapheretima (2 spp.)] and the genus Amynthas (3 spp.); the subgenus Pheretima includes five species in the P. urceolata group, six in the P. sangirensis group, one monothecate, and one athecate morphospecies. Four molecular markers were used: the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA genes and the nuclear 28S rRNA and protein-coding histone H3 genes. \nResults\nResults of the maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses of these data, with Dichogaster sp. as the outgroup, show that (1) the P. sangirensis group, defined by having a pair of spermathecae at intersegments 7/8, is monophyletic, only if the monothecate and athecate species are included, suggesting a fusion and loss of the spermathecae in each lineage; (2) the subgenus Parapheretima, defined by having secretory diverticula on the copulatory bursae, is non-monophyletic, suggesting that their respective secretory diverticula evolved independently; (3) the genus Amynthas is also non-monophyletic and is nested within Pheretima s.str., suggesting that the evolution or loss of either the nephridia on spermathecal ducts and/or the secondary male pores happened more than once; and (4) the P. urceolata group, defined by having a pair of spermathecae at intersegments 5/6, may or may not be monophyletic. \nSignificance\nThe addition of genetic markers with a rate of divergence lower than COI and 16S but not lower than 28S and H3 is necessary to obtain better resolution of the phylogeny of this “problematic” group.</string>
    <string name="id129">Presenting Author: Beet, Clare\n\nContact: clarebeet17@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Clare Beet, Ian Hogg, Gemma Collins, Don Cowan, Byron Adams, Diana Wall\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIn order to predict future changes in biodiversity for Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems, an accurate assessment of current levels of biodiversity and an understanding of past responses is required. Here, we sampled populations of three springtail (Collembola) species from 10 sites in the vicinity and to the north of the Mackay Glacier, which acts as a transitional zone between two biogeographic regions (northern and southern Victoria Land). Of the year-round terrestrial animals in Victoria Land, springtails have the narrowest environmental tolerances, and can therefore act as sensitive indicators of climate-driven environmental change. Accordingly, we assessed levels of diversity within and among populations of Gomphiocephalus hodgsoni, Cryptopygus nivicolus, and Antarcticinella monoculata using the mitochondrial COI (barcoding) gene. \nResults\n105 springtails were successfully sequenced, with highly divergent populations (cryptic species) found for each of the three putative springtail species within the region. Sampling also provided the first records of species from many of the sites visited. New records for the springtail species Antarcticinella monoculata and Cryptopygus nivicolus are of particular interest as they may indicate changes in distribution from previous collections undertaken in the early 1960’s. \nSignificance\nThis research will contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the region and provide an important baseline inventory against which to monitor future changes as well as enable protection of biodiversity hotspots for Antarctica’s terrestrial biota.</string>

In some cases, exploring novel approaches to surveillance allows them to achieve more with less. Work at Fera has focused on the development of meta-barcoding approaches to identify species composition of organisms in water and in the air. Early detection of airborne plant pathogens is essential to enable control measures to be implemented. This is particularly challenging when surveillance is for quarantine pathogens subject to control under Council Directive 2000/29/EC where any one of a long list of pathogens need to be identified (https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/phiw/riskRegister/). The community structure of freshwater benthic diatoms is linked to water quality and is used to make assessments as part of the EU Water Quality Framework. Identification work is currently done using light microscopy to resolve species based on the structure of the diatom ‘shell’ or frustule. \nResults\nWe have developed metabarcoding methods to allow monitoring of airborne fungal spores for quarantine/notifiable pathogens. We are also assessing the suitability of using samples collected with air samplers deployed for other purposes (e.g. pollen or air quality networks), as this has the potential to save costs and improve efficiency, potentially enabling profiling of samples to achieve multiple outcomes from the same samples. In addition, we are translating a meta-barcode approach for diatom community profiling into a high-throughput method to enable improvements in the efficiency, speed, and cost of water quality assessments. \nSignificance\nDNA-based methodologies have always had great promise for delivering testing services. DNA barcoding in particular is a generic technique for resolving taxa. When coupled with next generation sequencing, metabarcoding potentially offers efficient, high-throughput species identification.</string>
    <string name="id379">Presenting Author: Geary, Janis\n\nContact: janis.geary@ualberta.ca\n\nAuthors: Janis Geary, Tania Bubela\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nAs an international effort to create a publicly accessible database, the International Barcode of Life Project (iBOL) is vulnerable to cultural differences and social dilemmas that may discourage individuals from participating. We apply the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) Framework, which is a tool used to study types of “commons” (shared resources), to understand participation in iBOL. iBOL commons include barcode databases and the repositories that store voucher specimens. Collectively, the barcodes and specimens are genetic resources, governed by national laws that implement the Nagoya Protocol to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Concern over the use of genetic resources differs between researchers in the Global North and the resource-poor, but biodiversity-rich Global South. These cultural, societal, and legal differences can create divide in the global barcoding community over how the shared resources should be managed. The success of iBOL is contingent on promoting use of the resource as well as re-contribution of value-added data, while remaining sensitive to the divide in interests of researchers. Accomplishing this balance requires a set of rules that coordinates the behaviours of the different actors that comprise the international barcoding community. \nResults\nWe completed 44 semi-structured interviews with members of the iBOL community, funding agencies, and external stakeholders. Interviewees discussed many topics including research collaborations, genetic resource collection, data release, and knowledge about the CBD. Through applying the IAD Framework, we analysed these interviews within the broad context of iBOL including print media representations, policies of iBOL and major funding agencies, requirements of the CBD, and publication/data release patterns of the barcoding community. \nSignificance\nOur research identifies cultural, societal, and legal differences between international participants and stakeholders that are impacting participation in iBOL. We suggest strategies to mitigate identified conflicts and will invite discussion to further develop these strategies.</string>

Our goal was to apply theories on technological diffusion to barcoding. Theories point to drivers of diffusion as (1) opinion leaders; (2) early adopters; (2) enabling infrastructure; (3) supportive institutional structures; (4) demonstrated utility. \nResults\nWe searched the Scopus database on April 23, 2015, for all publications that cited 4 seminal barcoding papers (2 barcoding technology: Hebert et al., 2003, PNAS, and Hollingsworth et al., 2009, PNAS; BOLD barcode database: Ratnasingham & Hebert, 2007, Mol. Ecol. Notes; iBOL: Stoeckle & Hebert, 2008, Sci. Am.). We retrieved 2743 distinct publications that cited these four seed articles and stored these in a MySQL database. We disambiguated author names and geocoded individual author affiliations to latitude and longitude. We used Sci2 (https://sci2.cns.iu.edu) for co-author network analyses using these 10375 unique authors and their affiliations. Using Sci2 and enhanced network visualization capabilities of Gephi (http://gephi.github.io/), we positioned the co-authorship network on a global map. We used Gephi to calculate network statistics. We characterized articles by taxonomic focus and theme (e.g., applied biomonitoring, education, systematics, informatics). Barcoding researchers have spread from their base in North America to every populated continent. There are strong linkages amongst researchers in developed countries and increasing participation of researchers from emerging economies and developing countries. China has become a leader in plant barcoding. While the taxonomic applications still dominate in the literature, barcoding applications have expanded over time. \nSignificance\nBarcoding is an exemplar of the rapid and global spread of an innovation in the absence of formal proprietization. Its diffusion is not only in volume but in scope of applications. Institutional structures and opinion leaders have been key drivers. Further diffusion is likely with regulatory acceptance of the technology.]]></string>
    <string name="id524">Presenting Author: Borisenko, Alex\n\nContact: aborisen@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Alex Borisenko\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\niBOL has globalized the effort of building an open reference platform for DNA-based identification of living organisms. This has allowed institutions in biodiverse but technologically under-resourced nations to outsource the analytical component of their research to core analytical facilities in countries possessing sufficient technological capacity. The Nagoya Protocol (NP) under the Convention on Biological Diversity sets out new guidelines for international transfer of biological materials that may have a serious impact on the future of this collaboration. \nResults\nIt is critical to ensure that ratification or accession to NP does not undermine access of developing countries to genomic tools for assessing biodiversity or hamper the construction of global reference libraries. First, it is vital to draw a clear distinction between basic DNA barcoding analysis and genomic bioprospecting for commercial purposes. This should be formalized by streamlining and standardizing the protocols for exchange of genetic resources across the iBOL network; in particular, the development of a universal Material Transfer Agreement template that would secure Prior Informed Consent from the Provider and include clearly articulated Mutually Agreed Terms of analyses. Such documents should address international practices of genome data sharing (e.g., Fort Lauderdale Principles) and be inclusive of iBOL partner countries that have not ratified or acceded to NP. Next, it is important to alleviate discrepancies between above protocols and changes to national legal frameworks related to NP implementation. \nSignificance\nThe iBOL community is deeply familiar with real-world challenges of international collaboration in collecting, aggregating, and sharing biodiversity genomics information covered by NP. It should use its unique position to provide a strong and consolidated voice on relevant policy developments at both international and national levels. Building a coordinated network-wide set of protocols for specimen transfer will ensure that national sovereignty over genetic resources is exercised without undermining basic biodiversity research.</string>

Future invasions may happen via diverse pathways and ports of entry, calling for a robust nationwide system for rapid detection and response. Numerous case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of DNA barcoding as a tool for quarantine and environmental detection of invasive organisms in both forensic and bulk samples; however, their scope has been limited. DNA barcoding should be broadly deployed and integrated into a nation-wide biosurveillance effort with a conceptually novel operational framework, supported by several important changes in legislation, policy, and governance. 1. DNA-based identification should be incorporated into Canadian federal legislation, as an accepted standard for validating the taxonomic identity of invasive organisms and the basis of rapid response management, 2. It should be broadly adopted by key relevant federal agencies, such as DFO, CFIA, Transport Canada, Environment Canada, and Parks Canada as part of their operating policies for monitoring and control of the spread of invasive species. 3. The creation of a shared, federally accredited and universally accessible DNA barcode reference dataset based on existing data platforms (such as BOLD or CANADENSYS) should be authorized under the respective articles of Canadian law for the above agencies. 4. Legislative provisions/incentives need to be in place for the submission of raw digital DNA-based information from environmental surveillance activities (e.g., impact assessments) into a centralized data portal, to facilitate monitoring and detection of important invasive species. 5. Efforts should be in place to garner support from provinces, territories, and other jurisdictions in adopting similar legislations and facilitating data sharing/exchange. 6. DNA barcoding should become part of the agenda in trade negotiations between Canada and its key trading partners (e.g., those with signed FTA’s), in an effort to harmonize regulatory frameworks at an international level.</string>

Lyal, Anne Nivart, China Williams, Peter Giere\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nWith the Nagoya Protocol (NP) taking effect on 12 October 2014, the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources is regulated under a strong global legal framework. It obliges all parties of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to access genetic resources outside national borders legally and to ensure that utilisation inside their national borders is in compliance with the international legal framework and its national implementation. With the Nagoya Protocol in effect combined with implementation of European Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) legislation, illegal accession and utilisation can be prosecuted. \nResults\nThis will affect traditional and modern biodiversity research, natural history collections, and transfer of objects and samples worldwide. As the NP regulates genetic resources (GR) in general, it reaches beyond organismal research, including disciplines like climate science (GR in drill cores, water, or soil samples) or archaeo sciences (archaeobotany, archaeozoology, and archaeology) exploring ancient DNA. To allow compliance with national and international ABS laws, additional reporting and documentation is required to demonstrate legal acquisition and utilisation of genetic resources accessed outside one’s own national borders. This affects natural history collections and collection management in signatory and non-signatory countries (such as the USA), but also samples transferred for biocontrol or for identification without NP-conform documentation. \nSignificance\nThe European legislation calls for voluntary measures to reach ABS compliance, latest in October 2015. The Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities (CETAF), a major European network of taxonomic institutions, set up a group to examine the legal issues. The set of guidance documents developed so far include a common Code of Conduct and Best Practice for taxonomic collections. Natural History Collections and researchers worldwide are advised to revise processes and policies and to form networks of (taxonomic) institutions that have CBD-conform procedures in place.</string>

Undergraduate students at UC San Diego are creating an inventory of invertebrate biodiversity at an ecological reserve adjacent to campus. Ecology and molecular biology students in large-enrollment laboratory classes collaborate to collect, document, and generate DNA sequence data. Recently we have scaled up to include minority-serving community colleges in the region. To make this possible, staff at the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario have redesigned the BOLD Student Data Portal to cater to the university classroom. Most importantly, the new University Student Data Portal (uni.boldsystems.org) will facilitate sharing data across different classrooms and campuses. \nResults\nIn 2.5 years, over 1700 undergraduate students have participated, successfully generating BOLD-compliant consensus sequences for 67 percent of the 727 specimens that have been collected. For certain taxa, students collect many species that are new to BOLD; for example, 31 percent of the spider individuals are new additions to the database. We have assessment data that documents student perceptions of original research in the classroom and the effect of such research on student self-efficacy and science identity. \nSignificance\nThe benefits of incorporating original research into the classroom are well established in the science education literature. DNA barcoding, in addition, helps students comprehend the biodiversity knowledge gap. An undergraduate describes her reaction to the research this way, “I think it did affect (me) because for whatever reason I assumed that all the species in the near vicinity had already been discovered and sequenced and everything was all in place, like there were people doing this. But then with the barcoding experiment you realize that there are a lot more species out there that can be studied…”</string>

The School Butterfly Project began in September 2014 with the aims to increase awareness of biodiversity and to instill a sense of stewardship for local wildlife among schoolchildren. Five schools in five different states of Peninsular Malaysia were approached to participate in the project, with about 30 school children of each school, aged 9-12 years. A sixth group included home-schooled children from the Kuala Lumpur area. \nResults\nDuring the first stage of the project, we visited each school for an interactive training day. Following the training sessions, the schoolchildren were provided with a sampling kit and tasked with collecting butterfly samples in their schoolyards or local parks for four times over the next 12 months. The first sampling day took place in October 2014, and collectively the schoolchildren sampled around 120 butterflies. Butterfly legs were sent to the Museum of Zoology, University of Malaya for DNA barcoding, which revealed that the sample included 40 butterfly species. Several dominant species such as the Striped Wanderer, Appias olferna, and the Tawny Coster, Acraea terpsicore, are relative newcomers to Peninsular Malaysia. \nSignificance\nTo the best of our knowledge, the School Butterfly Project is the first project in Malaysia that introduces primary schoolchildren to scientific research, and it has generated positive interest from the local media. In the short term we look forward to the next sampling days and to explore if, and how, butterfly diversity changes throughout the year. In the long term we look forward to exploring ways to expand the reach of the project across the country and society.</string>
    <string name="id504">Presenting Author: James, Karen E.\n\nContact: kjames@mdibl.org\n\nAuthors: Karen E. James\n\nAbstract:\nClimate change is shifting species’ geographic ranges, patterns, abundances, seasonal activities, and interactions with other species. Understanding, predicting, and managing how species respond to climate change and other environmental changes is a critical challenge in environmental biology, which will require what Georgina Mace called a new kind of ecology…predicated on scaling up efforts, data sharing and collaboration. Collection of these kinds of data typically requires the identification of biological specimens; yet, that task is difficult and labor-intensive, and is compounded by a dearth of taxonomic expertise – the “taxonomic impediment”. Citizen science is proposed – and has in some cases been successfully implemented – as a mechanism for expanding the scientific workforce to address difficult, large-scale, or computationally intensive ecological research questions. Unfortunately, training citizen scientists to accurately identify most organisms is, like the task of identification itself, prohibitively time-consuming. Thus projects that engage the public in identifying biological specimens, including bioblitzes, still rely heavily on professional taxonomists to identify collected specimens, and the taxonomic impediment remains in place. Automated identification tools that use morphology (e.g. Leafsnap), sound (e.g. Song Scope) and other characteristics, and online crowd-sourced photo identification services (e.g. iNaturalist, iSpot), are already being used to help citizen scientists identify unknown specimens. DNA-assisted species identification (“DNA barcoding” and related techniques) can complement these tools to empower researchers and citizen scientists alike to accurately identify organisms and enable transformative increases in the scope and scale at which ecology and biodiversity science are done. In this talk, I will report on the progress of “BioTrails”, an NSF-funded collaboration of the MDI Biological Laboratory, Acadia National Park, and the Schoodic Institute, to demonstrate the DNA-assisted citizen science concept and build capacity for local, national, and international expansion.</string>
    <string name="id540">Presenting Author: Milton, Megan A.\n\nContact: mmilton@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Megan A. Milton, Paola Pierossi, Sujeevan Ratnasingham\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n Engaging students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) has become a major priority for educators. As STEM-based careers emerge and define a global shift in innovation, the need for hands-on STEM-oriented activities for educational purposes becomes clear. DNA barcoding, through early studies, has been shown to be an effective activity for STEM education. The application of DNA barcoding combines knowledge from biodiversity, genomics, and bioinformatics fields in a cost-effective way, enabling its use in education. BOLD Systems now provides some of the infrastructure necessary to make this technology accessible in supporting both teacher-led and independent education. We discuss the tools developed by BOLD for this purpose and provide examples on their use. \nResults\n Many students and citizen scientists have expressed an interest in contributing to the DNA barcoding initiative via the Barcode of Life Data (BOLD) Systems, a dedicated platform developed for DNA barcoding. However, this platform is targeted at professional scientists and post-graduate students due to the complexity of interfaces and assumed subject matter experience from users. This limitation is addressed through two other systems, the BOLD Student Data Portal (BOLD-SDP) and LifeScanner. BOLD-SDP was developed based on the scientific barcoding workflow but with greatly simplified interfaces targeting high-school and undergraduate classrooms. This portal supports teacher-led research projects involving the generation of DNA barcodes. A key aspect of this system is that results of classroom experiments lead to novel data being contributed to the BOLD database and GenBank. SDP provides special tools for instructors to support the monitoring and publishing of student work. Since its activation in 2013, BOLD-SDP has been used by over 200 instructors and 4000 students from 10 countries. The LifeScanner mobile identification tool was developed in part to support independent barcode-based research by users of any age. LifeScanner consists of mobile software that provides a very simple interface to BOLD and specimen collection kits that enable to acquisition of DNA barcodes and barcode-based species identifications. \nSignificance\n By equipping students and educators with technology and the support framework to implement programs, BOLD exposes students to new technologies that increase their understanding and interest in STEM careers.</string>
    <string name="id248">Presenting Author: Breton, Vanessa\n\nContact: bretonv@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Emily Berzitis, Vanessa Breton, Dirk Steinke\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nWith the primary goal of engaging students in current research and fostering their interest in biodiversity and, more broadly, the environment, the School Malaise Trap Program was developed by the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario (BIO) in 2013. Since its inception, over 7,000 elementary and secondary school students from nearly 200 schools across Canada have participated in the program, deploying Malaise traps in their schoolyards for a specific two-week period in either the spring or fall. By barcoding the specimens collected at each school, BIO is contributing a wealth of new records to the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) with the help of these young citizen scientists. \nResults\nOver the course of four offerings of the program, schools have collected close to 200,000 specimens and more than 40,000 were then barcoded at BIO. These specimens represented 4,875 BINs, 733 of which were new to BOLD. Only a small proportion of these species were collected in both the spring and fall, demonstrating the importance, in terms of library building, of running the program multiple times a year. \nResults also suggest that offering the program to schools located in already heavily-sampled areas can still be scientifically (and educationally) valuable, with a school in Guelph, Ontario collecting 12 species that were new to BOLD in the fall of 2014. \nSignificance\nIn addition to encouraging environmental stewardship and introducing students of all ages to DNA barcoding, the School Malaise Trap Program has demonstrated its continued utility for library building, with great promise for expansion outside of Canada.</string>
    <string name="id489">Presenting Author: Bradley Zlotnick,\n\nContact: sdbarcodeoflife@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Bradley Zlotnick, Joshua Kohn, David Dannecker, Valérie Lévesque-Beaudin\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIn February 2014, ResMed, Inc., a leading San Diego medical sciences company, engaged the San Diego Barcode of Life (SDBOL) and became the first corporate partner to join iBOL in DNA barcoding its community’s biodiversity. ResMed committed to an initial 52 consecutive week collection, instituting the Global Malaise Program (GMP) protocol at their nine-acre headquarters site (half of which is an open-space sculpture garden) in central urban/industrial San Diego. ResMed barcoding aimed to document flying insect diversity in its urban setting, advance barcode indexing generally, model corporate community involvement in science for employees and the public, and inspire expansion of Malaise trapping in the region. Managed by University of California, San Diego, faculty and students from their San Diego Biodiversity Project, the trap supplements ongoing SDBOL GMP and related activities. \nResults\nThirty-nine weeks of consecutive sampling acquired 8,103 specimens (range, 43-403 individuals/week). 86 percent of specimens were successfully barcoded, with 631 putative species in at least 15 orders, generating 129 unique BINs for BOLD. Species accumulation curves were similar to less urban sites, suggesting approximately 1,303 species will potentially surface with continued sampling. Employee engagement began with facilities staff, adding an employee vegetable garden group, and developing a corporate communications video of the ResMed iBOL project for an all-employee assembly and global website in April 2015. The ResMed project’s progress stimulated further investment in SDBOL and iBOL: ResMed sponsored the first complete DNA barcoding of a globally important regional flora--the San Diego Plant Atlas--at the San Diego Natural History Museum. A regional technology and life sciences consortium is considering expansion of a Corporate Malaise Program with SDBOL. \nSignificance\nResMed’s substantial participation with SDBOL marks notable iBOL firsts: 52 consecutive week Malaise dataset; corporate Malaise site; corporate participant in SDBOL, GMP, iBOL. With their desire to model corporate engagement, ResMed is stimulating SDBOL growth and inspiring other iBOL regions.</string>

Trizna\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL) was granted a US$3 million Google Global Impact Award in December 2012 for a barcoding project with six developing ‘partner countries’. Mexico, Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria joined the project immediately, and Nepal joined recently. A Latin American partner is still being sought. The Barcode of Wildlife Project (BWP) is devoted to demonstrating the impact of barcoding on the prosecution of poachers and traffickers in endangered species. Each country selected 200 priority endangered species that are protected under CITES and/or their national laws. BWP has provided training, supplies, reagents, support for fieldwork, technical, and other support to enable to begin contributing BARCODE records to GenBank for the priority endangered species and related and look-alike species. The project had a roadmap, milestones, and a timeline for library construction and development of barcoding capabilities in enforcement agencies. SOPs for library construction had to meet the needs of enforcement agencies. BWP was committed to processing all samples in-country to avoid controversies surrounding export of genetic resources. \nResults\nCBOL had good working relationships with barcode researchers in each country but no links to enforcement agencies. Building strong working relations between research and enforcement sectors has been a slow process that began with a workshop on legal standards. After in-country training and regular support by videoconference, thousands of very high-quality BARCODE records are being submitted to GenBank, and crime scene evidence is being barcoded. \nSignificance\nInitiatives such as BWP can convince government agencies to adopt barcoding as a regulatory system and support it on a long-term basis. The BARCODE data standard will need to be adjusted to meet these requirements. As regulations about access and benefit sharing are implemented, GenBank records will need to come increasingly from in-country barcoding labs for which training and capacity-building will be needed.</string>
    <string name="id549">Presenting Author: Trizna, Michael\n\nContact: triznam@si.edu\n\nAuthors: Michael Trizna, David Schindel\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe Barcode of Wildlife Project (BWP) is a multi-year project with six developing partner countries that are preparing to use DNA barcoding to prosecute wildlife crimes. This forensic use of barcodes requires more complete documentation so CBOL required datafields in addition to those required by the existing Barcode Data Standard. CBOL worked with the BiSciCol project to construct a Field Information Management System (FIMS) that populated and validated high-quality specimen and collection metadata as soon as possible in the process. The FIMS is able to serve specimen data to the Geneious Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS), originally developed by the Moorea Biocode barcoding project. The FIMS and LIMS feed data to a new timeline-based dashboard to pinpoint bottlenecks in the workflow. Finally, CBOL worked with Geneious developers to overhaul the GenBank Submission Plug-in, which now meets all of the DNA barcode submission needs, as well as the extended fields being used for the BWP Project. Training was provided through an in-country workshop and frequent videoconferencing. Since the informatics pipeline was custom created for this project, each step of the pipeline has been refined and reworked to address the feedback and experience of the BWP users. \nResults\nThree of the earliest countries in the BWP have used the informatics pipeline to process over a thousand high-quality BARCODE keyword records for protected plant and animal species that will be the first BWP data release. The pipeline software is open source and is available online along with documentation and training materials. \nSignificance\nThis informatics pipeline provides the barcoding community with a system for assembling, validating, and submitting GenBank records in compliance with the Barcode Data Standard. The extended BWP Data Standard may meet the needs of other regulatory applications of barcoding.</string>
    <string name="id171">Presenting Author: Wesselink, Monique\n\nContact: m.wesselink@nfi.minvenj.nl\n\nAuthors: Monique Wesselink, Irene Kuiper\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nTaxonomical identification of seized items is often needed to determine whether a crime has been committed. When seized items have been processed into art works, medicines, or other objects, insufficient morphological identification characteristics are often present; therefore, DNA-based techniques are increasingly being used. From a forensic point of view, the (local and international) legislation determines the level of identification needed. In some cases, only determination of the family or genus is necessary, but in other cases, species, subspecies, or even population determination may be required. \nResults\nAs legal definitions determine which level of identification is needed, barcoding markers may be 1) applicable, 2) insufficient, or 3) too informative. To benefit from barcoding initiatives, most techniques for mammalian species identification are based on the mitochondrial marker COI. Many seized items can be readily identified through use of (parts of) this marker, excluding all but one species as the source of the DNA. Drawbacks include the inability to detect hybrids due to the marker’s maternal inheritance, the fact that not all species are readily distinguished, and that subspecies and population differentiation generally requires the use of other techniques. Nuclear DNA markers, additional mitochondrial DNA markers, and next-generation sequencing may be needed to overcome these challenges. \nSignificance\nAlthough DNA-based techniques may be the only methods to identify seized samples, the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA and inability to distinguish between species and their hybrids has been pointed out as a potential pitfall in a court of law. In our experience, some local and international flora and fauna regulations are not at all hampered by nuances at the species/hybrid level (e.g. when genera/families/orders are regulated), but in other cases (e.g. distinction between species and their hybrids) mitochondrial DNA markers alone cannot be used to answer the relevant forensic questions.</string>
    <string name="id501">Presenting Author: Topan, Janet\n\nContact: jtopan@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Janet Topan\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEver since DNA fingerprinting had revolutionized criminal forensic science, interest in non-human DNA analysis has been growing. With endangered wildlife trade and adulteration of food products being on the rise, DNA-based identification methods offer a solution that empowers regulatory and enforcement agencies to prevent such illegal activities. Forensic identification of wildlife and even more so verification of food ingredients are often challenged by the lack of morphological characters or access to taxonomic expertise in a timely fashion. Forensic identification of food products—including meat, poultry, and seafood—and the identification of wildlife samples thus require the use of genetic species identification techniques such as DNA barcoding. \nResults\nSince 2010, the Canadian Centre for DNA Barcoding (CCDB) core lab has processed 74 cases, with over 2000 samples, for identification of various animal and plants. Service was provided to a wide range of clients including a number of government agencies (16), corporate clients (30), universities (13), news media companies (5), private citizens (3), and internal projects (7). Of the 2000 samples processed, 28 percent were from seafood products; 16 percent were from other food items; 8.3 percent were for wildlife identification; 13.2 percent were from cases involving insect identification; 24.4 percent were from cases related to environmental sampling; 8.5 percent were for plant identification; and 1.2 percent were related to health safety. For these forensic cases, 92.6 percent of barcodes were identified to genus or species, and 1.85 percent were identified to family. \nSignificance\nDetailed review of a few of the most striking examples, spanning a wide range of sample conditions and testing requirements, illustrates strong expertise of the CCDB in forensic applications of DNA barcoding and confirms that DNA barcoding provides a cost-efficient and effective solution for identification of samples, with legal implications in wildlife conservation and consumer health and safety.</string>
    <string name="id220">Presenting Author: Kalyankar, Amol\n\nContact: amol.hariom@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Amol Kalyankar, Rahul Jamdade, Rahul Jamdade, Gulab Khedkar\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\n In the wake of trade liberalization under WTO agreement, international trading in agricultural products, foods, pharmaceuticals, and marine products has facilitated massive extraction of natural resources and ultimately has created potential risks to biodiversity. Practical concerns to managing the ornamental fish species under trade include the recognition of fish by their common names. Interestingly, the rapid rate of hybridization and sometimes mutations (natural or imposed) are creating variations among the same species of fish, which are recognized by different names. Besides, juvenile fish are often cumbersome to identify to the species level even for experts. Therefore, the correct identification of ornamental fish using morphological characters is often difficult and requires expert help. Also, it is challenging to judge the origin of ornamentals, such as wild, cultured, or exotic, etc., as over one billion individual fish are traded annually through more than 148 countries. \nResults\n Our study covers a collection of 940 ornamental fishes collected from aquarium retailers, wholesalers, and exporters from India. Moreover, almost 673 wild ornamental fish specimens were collected from eight major rivers in India. All collected specimens were barcoded and analysed to determine species boundaries, mean genetic differences, and genetic distances to nearest neighbor species (barcode gap analysis). Several cryptic species were recorded in this study. We detected some issues with unexpectedly high intraspecific divergences, cases which were resolved using different approaches. Overall, our paper demonstrates high ambiguities in names currently used in fish trading, which may help traders to escape regulation or prosecution. \nSignificance\n This study highlights the misuse of common names in the trading of banned fish, which may cause potential losses to biodiversity.</string>
    <string name="id529">Presenting Author: Zhou, Xin\n\nContact: xinzhou@genomics.cn\n\nAuthors: Xin Zhou, Karl Kjer\n\nAbstract:\nDNA barcodes have been adopted in routine applications in a wide range of research fields (e.g., species identification, DNA taxonomy, life-stage association, phylogenetics, diet analysis, biodiversity survey, biomonitoring). As a critical linkage that bridges taxonomy, biology, and genomics of a particular taxon, DNA barcodes have also demonstrated significant contribution to large-scale “-omics” studies. Genome sequencing typically would start with a sufficient amount of tissues—sometimes from varied resources and times—creating an unpredictable chance for errors in mixing cross-taxon tissues. On the other hand, RNA-seq of non-model organisms requires field samples collected directly into liquid nitrogen or RNAlater, providing a huge challenge for taxonomic identification of sequenced taxa. This presentation will demonstrate the usefulness of DNA barcoding in the pipeline of “-omics” studies suffering from taxonomic or QA/QC issues.</string>
    <string name="id38">Presenting Author: RANJITH M T,\n\nContact: ranjith.mt16@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: RANJITH M. T., MANI CHELLAPPAN, HARISH E R\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nHelicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a polyphagous agricultural pest of global importance, harbours diverse gut bacterial communities. The gut bacteria community of H. armigera was analysed previously by isolation and cultivation techniques and polymerized chain reaction (PCR) based cloning methods, resulting in identification of few groups of bacteria. We explored the composition and diversity of gut bacteria in nine samples of H. armigera using Illumina next-generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S ribosomal RNA amplicons. \nResults\nOur data set consists of 864,813 high-quality, paired-end sequences with average length of 150 bp. We found a highly diverse bacterial community in the sample, containing approximately 2,303 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on their sequence similarity using the UCLUST program (similarity cutoff = 0.97). The Illumina sequencing data were submitted to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) of GenBank as a file under accession number SRR1914365. A total of 17 bacterial phyla, 34 classes, 84 orders, 173 families, 334 genera, and 707 species were identified by comparing sequences against the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) via the metagenomics RAST (MG-RAST) server. Actinobacteria were the most dominant group, followed by Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes. Searches regarding the function of the different gut-inhabiting bacteria of H. armigera revealed their role in nutrition, detoxification of lethal insecticidal molecules, and defensive action against pathogens. Insecticidal toxin-producing bacterial species were also found associated with H. armigera. \nSignificance\nThe present study paves the way to quantifying the total bacteria community associated with the gut of H. armigera and understanding how it aids different physiological activities, which are important factors that contribute to this species being a pest of global importance. Further studies will focus on sequencing the whole gut metagenome of H. armigera, identifying the functional pathway of every representative species, investigating the effect of removal of the gut bacterial community on survival of the insect, and establishing whether insecticidal toxin-producing bacterial species could play a major role as biocontrol agent.</string>
    <string name="id320">Presenting Author: Wright, Michael\n\nContact: mwrigh06@uoguelph.ca\n\nAbstract: Michael Wright, Donald Baird, Mehrdad Hajibabaei\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nBenthic invertebrates are commonly used as biological indicators of ecosystem change due to their sensitivity to environmental impacts and their ubiquity across aquatic systems. However, the large numbers of individuals typically found within samples and the large sample sizes within projects mean that a substantial amount of time is required to sort and identify specimens. Environmental barcoding, or the next-generation sequencing of bulk environmental samples for standard DNA markers (e.g., DNA barcodes), allows us to rapidly identify a range of taxa with equal sequencing effort; however, there are few examples of this technique highlighting temporal changes in communities. The Peace-Athabasca Delta (PAD) is a dynamic, highly connected wetland system in northern Alberta that hosts large numbers of migratory birds and some of the last free-roaming wood buffalo. Because of its high diversity and international importance, the PAD is an excellent study site to obtain baseline measures of ecosystem change through environmental barcoding. \nResults\nAs part of the Biomonitoring 2.0 project (www.biomonitoring2.org), we sequenced two regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene from the bulk DNA extracts of 90 benthic samples collected in June and August of 2012 and 2013, subsequently identifying a range of invertebrate taxa including annelids, molluscs, insects, and other arthropods. Through various measures of diversity, our approach showed variation in communities at different taxonomic levels from order to molecular operational taxonomic units. \nSignificance\nEnvironmental barcoding is able to show temporal shifts in benthic macroinvertebrate community assemblages, which allows for the rapid assessment of wetlands without time spent sorting and identifying specimens. When incorporated into a biomonitoring program, this can allow for an increased focus on sampling capacity. While there are still issues existing with reference database coverage, detecting abundance, and the destruction of specimens during sample processing, environmental barcoding has the potential to add information that traditional methods miss.</string>
    <string name="id96">Presenting Author: Wangh, Lawrence\nContact: wangh@brandeis.edu\n\nAuthor: Nicola Sirianni, Lawrence Wangh\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nTraditional DNA sequencing methods suggest that the Folmer Region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene of each animal species on earth is unique. This is the basis of the International Barcode of Life Initiative. Building on this, we have described an alternative, rapid, easy-to-use, closed-tube method called Virtual Barcoding that should also be able to distinguish all animal species on earth without sequencing. Virtual Barcoding utilizes Linear-After-The-Exponential PCR to generate single-stranded DNA amplicons containing COI sequences. These targets are coated at end-point with Lights-On/Lights-Off probes in one or more fluorescent colours. The resulting fluorescent signatures can be characterized and catalogued automatically. Proof-of-principle experiments using ten probes to a portion of the Folmer Region in five species of nematodes have been described (Rice et al. 2014, DOI: 10.3109/19401736.2014.947581). \nResults\nA set of fifteen universal probes to the Folmer Region has now been designed. Because each probe is mismatch tolerant and independently hybridizes over a range of temperatures, this set can theoretically distinguish tens of millions of sequence variants. The resulting fluorescent signatures from nematodes to mammals and birds suggest major steps in COI gene evolution. \nSignificance\nVirtual Barcoding is convenient, highly reproducible, and inexpensive. It can be used for rapid characterization of small multicellular and single-celled species that are difficult to classify on the basis of morphology. Moreover, because one or both of the primers driving amplification can have narrow specificity, the amplifiable sequences can be restricted to species within a particular genus, populations within a species, or mixtures of species. Virtual Barcoding is also amenable to use with a handheld device for immediate detection and diagnosis of species “in-the-field”. In addition, it will be possible to extend Virtual Barcoding to identification of plant species.</string>

Our research evaluates whether DNA metabarcoding is an appropriate method for measuring diversity in both terrestrial arthropods and their associated bacterial groups using a study area of three plots of tropical dry forest with differing land-use histories within a 2 square kilometer section of the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Environmental DNA (eDNA) was obtained from nine Malaise traps and amplified using multiple primer sets: 3 cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) arthropod minibarcode primers and 2 16S primers targeting the V3, V4, and V6 variable regions. Following sequencing with an Illumina MiSeq, sequences were identified to species level using the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) and GenBank databases for COI, and to genus level using RDPipeline for 16S. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were assembled for both COI and 16S sequences at 98 percent and 97 percent sequence similarity, respectively. Statistical analysis of beta diversity using the VEGAN package for R was performed at various taxonomic levels and with OTUs for both COI and 16S. \nResults\nSignificant arthropod and bacterial beta diversity is present for taxonomic data and OTUs. OTUs outperform taxonomic identification at capturing the genetic diversity present within the available sequence data (85 percent of good quality sequence vs 19 percent) and in correlating it to site differences. Of the COI OTU clusters, 62 percent could be assigned to orders, yielding 19 orders inclusive of the seven identified with species-level assignment. \nSignificance\nThis research demonstrates the viability of metabarcoding as a tool for the assessment of biodiversity using eDNA. The use of OTUs in conjunction with species- or genus-level identification captures available diversity where gaps in taxonomic classification are present.</string>

Popescu, Weijie Liu\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nWood decomposition releases almost as much CO2 as does fossil-fuel combustion, so the factors regulating wood decomposition can affect the global carbon cycle. \nResults\nWe used metabarcoding of the ITS2 marker to estimate the fungal species diversities of naturally colonized wood in subtropical China. Wood hosting more diverse fungal communities emitted less CO2, with Shannon diversity explaining 26 to 44 percent of emissions variation. Community analysis mostly supports a ‘pure diversity’ effect of fungi on decomposition rates. Our results extend previous experiments on low-diversity, laboratory-inoculated wood to a high-diversity, natural system, and we suggest that interference competition is the underlying mechanism. Experiments are now needed to determine the direction of causality. \nSignificance\nThe conservation of high levels of wood-decomposer fungal biodiversity may preserve a globally important ecosystem service by reducing the atmospheric contribution of CO2 made by the world’s stock of decomposing wood.</string>
    <string name="id30">Presenting Author: Yessoufou, Kowiyou\n\nContact: kowiyouyessoufou1@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Kowiyou Yessoufou, Michelle van der Bank\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSince the pair rbcLa and matK has been accepted as the core DNA barcode for terrestrial plants, many studies, perhaps surprisingly, continue to test the discriminatory power of these markers in many lineages. In Africa, and specifically in South Africa, we have moved on with the application of the core barcode in phylogenetic ecological studies. Using the core barcode to assemble the largest phylogeny of local, regional, and continental floras in Africa, we explored important questions related to community ecology (biological invasions and community responses to herbivory) and phylogenetic diversification (African cycads and \'underground forests\'). \nResults\nWe found that alien plants closely related to native flora naturalize, but those distantly related become invasive, thus resolving the Darwin’s Naturalization Conundrum. We further explored how native flora responds to disturbances driven by large mammals. We found that native communities that are phylogenetically clustered tend to become overdispersed and vice-versa in response to herbivory, indicating that community responses to disturbances are contingent upon initial conditions. The evolutionary history of the African native floras seems to be climatically mediated. For the African cycads, we found a pattern of constant radiation with mass extinction in addition to an explosive radiation in a Southern African clade that developed underground stems during the transition Pliocene–Pleistocene. We then extended our interests to the diversification history of the entire continental underground trees (beyond cycads). We found multiple independent origins almost synchronous with the South American counterparts, and that the development of this life form may have been mediated by the interactive effects of frequent fires and high precipitation. \nSignificance\nUsing the core DNA barcodes in phylogenetic ecological studies, we shed light on contemporary and evolutionary events that shape the present-day African flora, demonstrating the ecological significance of DNA barcoding beyond traditional species identification.</string>
    <string name="id55">Presenting Author: Gao, Lianming\n\nContact: gaolm@mail.kib.ac.cn\n\nAuthors: Lianming Gao, Dezhu Li, Jie Liu\n\nAbstract:\nThe genus Cephalotaxus (Taxaceae) is comprised of eight species and two varieties distributed in East Asia as understory trees in temperate montane forest. As there is a lack of clear-cut morphological differences among species, taxonomy of this genus is difficult and controversial. In this study, all species and varieties of Cephalotaxus were collected from the distribution range, with 2-11 individuals per taxon, for species delimitation using six candidate DNA barcodes (ITS, rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL-F, and psbK-psbI). Among the six DNA barcodes, ITS showed the highest species discrimination rate at 36.4 percent, followed by matK and trnL-F (27.3 percent), while rbcL and trnH-psbA exhibited the lowest rate (9.1 percent), by using tree-based (NJ) analysis. Combinations of all six DNA barcodes can significantly improve the discriminatory power (63.6 percent) for Cephalotaxus species identification. Based on DNA barcoding analysis, seven species, including a new species, were identified in Cephalotaxus, which correspond well with its distribution. Recent taxonomic revisions of Cephalotaxus were not supported by our analysis. DNA barcoding is an efficient tool for new species discovery and taxonomic revision.</string>

Upteri\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nEarlier, we successfully worked on two plant DNA barcode projects, one genera specific and the other involving tree species from a province. In recent efforts we are leading a consortium of six Council of Scientific and Industrial Research institutes to barcode plant species across India, where each institute is focusing on respective phytogeographic locations. As a part of this project, CSRI-NBRI is involved in DNA barcoding of a wild life sanctuary, Govind wild life sanctuary, in the west Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. \nResults\nWe have collected 238 angiosperms, 270 bryophytes, 255 pteridophytes, 265 lichens, and 154 algae species from the sanctuary, spanning a wide climatic range, mainly due to steep altitudinal gradient (1,300 m to 6,315 m above the sea level). So far we have analyzed 178 accessions of angiosperm plants from this hot spot using the four standard plant barcode loci. MatK was not used further after initial failure in PCR amplifications. PCR success ranged from 88 percent to 95 percent, trnH-psbA being the lowest and rbcL being the highest. ITS exhibited the lowest rate of sequencing success, while trnH-psbA exhibited the highest. ITS and trnH-psbA exhibited 90 percent success in species identification. Among the non-flowering plants, 75 accessions of lichen have been analyzed using ITS. PCR and sequencing success was 75 and 80 percent, respectively. Contamination with other fungus was a major problem faced during sequencing. Barcoding of other lower group of plants from this region will be carried out in the near future. Under the consortium, our main aim is to develop a plant barcode data base of high-value medicinal plants. \nSignificance\nBarcoding the flora, including a lower group of plant species of a particular hot spot, spanning a wide range of climatic zones, will certainly impact on conservation, policy making, and environmental protection by different government agencies. The study will also help testing the efficacy in resolving species identification in a specific geographic region.</string>
    <string name="id188">Presenting Author: Souto, Cintia P.\n\nContact: cintiap.souto@gmail.com\n\nAuthors: Cintia P. Souto, Paula Mathiasen, Mariana Tadey\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nUnder the current biodiversity crisis, an approach used to prioritize areas for biological conservation is the identification of “biodiversity hotspots,” which usually consist of large areas with exceptional concentrations of endemic species that are under threat due to habitat loss. In this study we used a method that integrates geographical information with intraspecific genetic polymorphism of species within a habitat type in order to identify genetic hotspots and suggest priority areas for conservation. Genetic hotspots are areas where multiple species have high genetic diversity and/or contain unique genetic variants, and may be used to set conservation priorities. We tested the hypothesis that plants with similar ecological tolerances were similarly shaped by evolutionary forces, resulting in genetic hotspots. \nResults\nWe mapped genetic diversity and unique variants of DNA barcoded markers (rbcLa + ITS2) for 75 plant species from Monte Desert, an area highly threatened by anthropological activities. Spatial distribution patterns of genetic polymorphisms differed among taxa according to their ecological tolerances. Several genetic hotspots were mapped, and we recommend conservation actions for some of them. \nSignificance\nBiodiversity hotspots are defined at a coarse scale and are often based on richness, endemism, threat, or a combination of these—but to date have not incorporated genetic data. Preserving the evolutionary potential of species is a major concern in conservation, as it may allow them to respond to a changing climate and ensure long-term population persistence. Mapping genetic hotspots can contribute to the design of effective conservation actions by detecting local areas with high genetic diversity, and the presence of unique gene variants—and thus presumably high evolutionary potential. Existing spatially explicit genetic data from the barcodes of multiple species can help to identify biodiversity hotspots and guide conservation actions to establish science-based protected areas that will preserve key habitats and species.</string>

Therefore, this medicinal plant is regarded as a panacea for blood stasis and an effective medicine for gynecological diseases. Given that Spatholobus suberectus Dunn leaks reddish-brown juices when cut, it has been named “Xueteng”. Moreover, Sargentodoxae Caulis (Da Xueteng), Kadsurae Caulis (Dian Jixueteng), and other stems with that same feature can also be called “Xueteng”. The phenomenon of homonyms in traditional Chinese medicine may lead to misuse because of different sources and varied efficacy. At present, various commercial Spatholobus products exist, including tablets, granules, syrups, and capsules. To guarantee clinical medication safety and better protect the legal rights and interests of consumers, we should clarify the species composition of these commercial Spatholobus products, which are difficult to identify using morphological characters. In this study, we use DNA barcoding as an authentication method. \nResults\nUp to 115 samples were collected from different habitats in China, which contained S. suberectus and its closely related species. ITS2 and psbA-trnH sequences were obtained in accordance with the DNA barcoding standard operating procedure. The maximum intraspecific genetic distances of Spatholobi Caulis in the ITS2 and psbA-trnH regions were 0.02 and 0.014, respectively. These distances were smaller than those of the interspecific ones. Furthermore, Spatholobi Caulis formed into a single branch in the NJ tree and can be distinguished from other species efficiently. The reference database was established from these samples, and its stability and reliability have already been tested. \nSignificance\nWe will use the existing database to investigate the materia medica of “Xueteng” and the commercial Spatholobus products, as well as to test the recovery of standard DNA barcodes for Spatholobi Caulis from a large array of commercial Spatholobus products to ensure accurate ingredient labels for consumers.</string>

However, a correlation between human population and species richness generates a conflict between human population growth and conservation goals. \nResults\nUsing a DNA barcode phylogeny of southern African trees, we show that human population correlates not only with tree species richness, but also with their phylogenetic diversity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that areas rich in phylogenetic diversity support a greater diversity of natural goods, indicating that the evolutionary processes responsible for generating variation among living organisms are also key to the provisioning of ecosystem services. \nSignificance\nOur study suggests that the distribution of humans in southern Africa may have been shaped by the evolutionary history of its flora.</string>

Bond\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe evolution of fire adaptations in savanna plants is an intriguing question in ecology and evolutionary biology. However, deeper insight is hindered by the lack of comprehensive molecular phylogeny. Here, we explored the origin of mesic savannas in Africa using geoxylic suffrutices (= geoxyles), White’s underground forests of Africa, as markers for fire-maintained ecosystems. First we reconstructed a time-calibrated phylogeny on the basis of DNA barcodes of southern African trees using 1400 woody taxa representing 117 families and 562 genera of Gymnosperms and Angiosperms; a total of 53 geoxyle taxa, representing 22 APG families, were included in the dataset. Then we used this phylogeny to test if African geoxyles emerge at similar times to those of the South American cerrado and used their phylogenetic position to date the appearance of humid savannas. \nResults\nResults suggest that mesic savannas first appeared in the tropics with more recent speciation at lower latitudes in southern Africa. We found multiple independent origins of the geoxyle life form mostly from the Pliocene (<5.3 Myr ago), with the majority of divergences occurring within the last 2 million years. Furthermore, geoxyles occur in regions characterized by higher rainfall and greater fire frequency. \nSignificance\nThis study provides the first evidence for dates of emergence of higher rainfall savannas in Africa and supports the role of fire in their origins. Furthermore, it illustrates the value of phylogenies based on DNA barcode sequence data as an alternative tool to explore origins of fire-adapted lineages and biomes.]]></string>

Kuzmina, Bradley A. Zlotnick\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nSan Diego County is a hotspot of global biodiversity within the similarly designated California Floristic Province. It holds the greatest documented plant diversity of any county in the contiguous United States: more than 2,600 taxa, approximately one-half as many plant species as Canada. The vouchered Plant Atlas of the San Diego Natural History Museum (SDNHM) previously consolidated knowledge of species distributions, geo-referencing specimens of each plant species within the County (http://www.sdplantatlas.org/). We aimed to enhance the Plant Atlas by assembling DNA barcodes and high-resolution images for all San Diego Country plant species, demonstrating the feasibility of DNA barcoding specimens. \nResults\nA technician sampled 2619 specimens representing 2579 species in 17 days from the San Diego Synoptic Collection of Plants. Three loci (rbcLa, ITS2, matK) were sequenced with 71.9 percent, 60.6 percent, and 52.0 percent specimen and 71.8 percent, 60.4 percent, and 51.7 percent species success, respectively, reflecting results consistent with previous barcoding projects on herbaria specimens. One gene locus was recovered from a specimen that was 131 years old (rbcLa), and another that was 91 years old yielded sequences for all three loci. Cumulative barcode information was used to construct a phylogeny for 2146 species of the plants of San Diego County, supplemented by concurrently digitized images of each taxon. \nSignificance\nWe carried out the rapid assembly of a barcode library for a globally important flora from a biodiversity hotspot, adding value to the San Diego County Plant Atlas, and providing the first genetic information for many of its taxa. SDNHM reference barcodes are being used for dietary analysis of regional herbivores and to test phylogeny and community assembly of this diverse flora. This success in DNA barcodes from the SDNHM herbaria has motivated plans to barcode animal collections at the same museum to provide a comprehensive San Diego Barcode of Life reference library.</string>

Each of the 5,117 species with non-hybrid origin (VASCAN) is represented by at least 1 barcode. \nResults\nFrom 2009-2015, we sampled 1-3 specimens per species and generated a total of 10,642 DNA barcodes with 86 percent coverage for rbcL, 47 percent for matK, and 75 percent for ITS2 (on average two loci per species). In order to assess the phylogeny-based method that is most effective for DNA barcode identification of Canadian vascular plant species, we compared the use of a mega phylogeny for all Canadian flora versus partial trees for the families (RAxML). In addition, we explored several methods of sequence alignment (MUSCLE, MUFFT, transAlign, SATe) to ascertain their effect on identification when using phylogeny. The advantages and limitations of using the marker combination of rbcL+ITS2 versus rbcL+matK are also examined. In addition, species-rich genera, especially groups with poor species resolution, were analyzed separately using all available sources of genetic information (that are found on BOLD and from GenBank), resulting in a potential recommendation for using additional supplementary markers for these groups to improve species discrimination. \nSignificance\nThis collaborative effort with researchers and herbaria across Canada presents the accumulation of the first DNA barcode library for an entire country’s vascular plant flora. It will serve as an important resource for a wide range of applications that require species-level identifications, including those in forensics, forestry, and conservation biology.</string>

Barone, Scott Whitley, JoVonn Hill\n\nAbstracts:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding is a molecular technique that allows for the identification of taxa from small tissue samples. By barcoding the plant material in feces, several studies have reported on the diets of species of herbivorous mammals, as well as some tropical leaf beetles. Here we describe the use of DNA barcoding to determine the diet of grasshoppers from their feces (or frass). At three prairie sites in eastern Mississippi, grasshoppers were captured, identified, and held in test tubes until they produced a frass pellet. They were then released, unharmed. Plant DNA was extracted from the frass, and the DNA was amplified through PCR using primers for the rbcL gene region found in the chloroplast genome of plants. After the PCR product was sequenced, the sequences were aligned and manually edited. \nResults\nFrom 250 initial samples, 63 yielded high quality, bi-directional sequences (with three additional uni-directional sequences) from 18 species of grasshoppers. Of these, 41 were homozygous, consisting of plant DNA from a single species. These were compared to a pre-existing DNA barcode library for prairie plants from Mississippi and Alabama. Fourteen samples were identified to a single plant species with greater than 99.5 percent pairwise identity, while 20 were identified to genus. The remaining eight samples were likely derived from plant species not in the barcode library. Twenty frass samples appeared to contain plant DNA from more than one species. \nSignificance\nBy using a previously established barcode library for Prairie plant species, our study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding to non-destructively determine the diets of grasshoppers and provide insight into the structure of community food webs.</string>

Chimphango, Michelle van der Bank, Olivier Maurin, A. Muthama Muasya\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nLarge-scale DNA barcoding provides a novel technique for species identification and evaluation of relationships across various levels (populations and species) and may reveal fundamental processes in recently diverged species. Here, we analysed DNA sequence variation in the recently diverged legumes from the Psoraleeae (Fabaceae) occurring in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR) of southern Africa to test the utility of DNA barcodes in species identification and discrimination. We further explored the phylogenetic signal on fire survival and regeneration strategies at species and generic levels. \nResult\nWe showed that psoraleoid legumes of the CFR exhibit a barcoding gap and high K values, yielding matK as a better barcode than rbcLa or combination of matK and rbcLa. We found a substantial match between genetic and morphologically-delimited genera and species, supporting the discriminatory power of DNA barcoding. We also found that different lineages showed a weak but significant phylogenetic conservatism in their affinity to fire as reseeders or resprouters, with a stronger clustering of resprouters than would be expected by chance. \nSignificance\nOur results showed that DNA barcoding may be valuable in aiding species identification in recently diverged lineages and for the detection of phylogenetic signal in some lineages from this unique biodiversity hotspot. These novel microevolutionary patterns might be acting continuously over time to produce multi-scale regularities of biodiversity.</string>

We derived three complete chloroplast genomes belonging to the different subgenera of the toxic Aconitum, aiming to discover new evidence for taxonomic and identification studies. \nResults\nThree complete chloroplast genomes of Aconitum were derived using high-throughput sequencing platforms, and sequence divergence analysis was performed. The three complete chloroplast genomes of Aconitum ranged from 155,769 to 157,327bp in length and contain a total of 130 genes, consisting of protein-coding genes, tRNA genes, and rRNA genes. The alignment of the three chloroplast genomes resulted in a similarity of 97 percent. The six highly conserved genes (cemA, psbB, psbC, rpoA, rpoC1, and rps4) amounted to 8117 bp after alignment, from which 154 variable sites were detected with a similarity of 98 percent and an average Kimura 2-parameter distance of 0.013. \nSignificance\nAs cost is no longer the limitation to full-genome sequencing, the establishment of a broad super-barcode database consisting of chloroplast genomes has become practical. Compared with current DNA barcodes, full chloroplast genomes represent a more comprehensive approach to species taxonomy and identification of the complex and toxic Aconitum.</string>

Showalter\nAbstract:Background\nIn Pakistan, herbal products are a primary source of medicines, yet quality control for raw plant material sold to individuals or companies is very limited. Large-scale cultivation of medicinal plants is not prevalent, so the bulk of raw material is imported from other countries or collected from the wild. Roots, bark, twigs, leaves, flowers, and seeds are sold under common names in local languages, so the potential for misidentifications and mixed collections is high. Misidentifications or adulteration of authenticated materials can lead to reduced effectiveness of herbal products or accidental poisonings. Barcoding provides a way to confirm the identification of raw plant material and establish a level of quality assurance. \nResults\nWe have generated barcodes from 156 medicinal plant species, representing 49 different families, using the rbcL, matK, and psbA-trnH spacer regions. Twenty-four market samples (28 percent of barcoded market material) were documented as adulterated or entirely misidentified, including common species like Melia azedarach, Borago officinalis, and Althaea officinalis. Comparisons of medicinal plant barcodes with those of sister species have indicated that the psbA-trnH spacer is most useful for distinguishing species, followed by matK and rbcL. \nSignificance\nBased upon scientific interactions and results of this work, Qarshi Industries, a leading producer of natural products and herbal pharmaceuticals in Pakistan, is enhancing its quality control by setting up a DNA barcoding laboratory to confirm the identities of plants used in their formulations and to detect potential adulteration.</string>
    <string name="id238">Presenting Author: R, Sathishkumar\n\nContact: rsathish@buc.edu.in\n\nAuthors: Dhivya S., Newmaster S. G., Ragupathy S., Saravanan M., Sathishkumar R.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nHerbal products are plant-derived natural remedies prone to frequent contamination and substitution by false or cheaper alternatives. The deceptive exploitation of herbal remedies is exponentially increasing due to illusive business practices, which has led to the substantial health risks for consumers. The leading cause for the unlawful practices is due to the lack of strict regulation of guidelines for good collection practices (GCP’s), good manufacturing practices (GMP’s), and market control laws, which are not being strengthened to eliminate false and low-quality herbal products. In this study we have applied DNA barcoding, a DNA-based method to test the authenticity of commercially available herbal products from India. We suggest the application of the technique by herbal industries for the enforcement of good quality control surveillance of herbal products. \nResults\nWe have generated a Biological Reference Material (BRM) herbal barcode library for 152 Indian herbal species using barcode regions (ITS2 and rbcL). We tested the authenticity of 93 herbal products representing 50 herbal species. Of these, 46 percent were determined to be authentic, and about 52 percent of the products contained species of plants not listed on the labels. Nearly 23 percent of the samples were contaminated with species from unrelated families, and 4 percent of the products contained fillers. We found contamination of products with legal substitutes of the drug that was scientifically supported. We also found some inadvertent adulterant species that were never recorded before through scientific evidence. Our overall findings suggest that no Indian herbal medicines contained products with pure/single herbal species as mentioned on their labels. We assume that the product is essentially mixed with one or few other herbs that can alleviate the therapeutic activity of the main ingredients. \nSignificance\nAt present, the available quality control (QC) methods and standards of herbal preparations established with modern analytical technologies are not very promising as the herbal preparations are typically prone to batch-to-batch variability in composition, concentration, contamination, and decisive adulteration. DNA barcoding has proven to be robust for building DNA barcode reference libraries and is reliable in identifying plant species from the processed plant materials. Therefore, the technique can be applied in the field of herbal pharmacovigilance to ensure the safety and efficacy of natural drugs.</string>
    <string name="id342">Presenting Author: Tahir, Aisha\n\nContact: atahir03@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Aisha Tahir, Steve G. Newmaster, Ragupathy, S., Amer Jamil\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nInhabitants of biodiversity-rich, but economically poor, areas of Pakistan are using indigenous plants for treating ailments in humans and animals, mainly because of unavailability of resources and basic medical facilities. Livelihood of many people in these areas is dependent on the export of these medicinal species to herbal companies. Traditional knowledge of the medicinal uses of plants provides new insights to the scientific community to explore the medicinal ingredients of these plants; this is supported by DNA barcoding that provides rapid and accurate species identification, which is a key to understanding the medicinal value of plants. The conservation of medicinal plants has been neglected in many areas of Pakistan. This is the first attempt to assemble a reference DNA barcode library for indigenous medicinal plants of Pakistan. \nResults\nWe sampled a total of 250 plants representing 137 species of traditionally used medicinal plants from different parts of the country. DNA barcoding was completed using rbcL and ITS2 markers. rbcL correctly identified 88 percent of the species, while ITS2 identified 78 percent of the species, and most taxa were identified at the family or genus level. This approach also resolved morphological identification issues of almost 40 species. Evaluation of the utility and species resolution power of two barcode regions (rbcL and ITS2) included the phylogenetic (neighbor-joining trees) and sequence similarity (all-to-all BLASTn searches) analyses. \nSignificance\nThis research expanded the reference library for medicinal plants of Pakistan, and provides a DNA barcoding tool for identifying medicinal plants. We concluded that DNA barcoding using the rbcL marker is an important tool for taxonomists for timely and correct species identifications to overcome the impediments of morphological identifications and identification of medicinal preparations. Proper implementation of this tool to monitor overexploitation of medicinal plants and adulteration of herbal products will improve the quality of herbal medicines, and ultimately improve the rural economy and conservation of biodiversity in Pakistan.</string>

However, accurate taxonomic identification of medicinal plants from markets is challenging, as traded plant materials are sold in processed forms such as dried roots and barks, powdered plant parts, and mixtures. Two methods of DNA barcode-based molecular identification are evaluated for species-level identification performance: a purely objective sequence matching method and an integrative approach that coalesces sequence matching with a priori and a posteriori data from other markers, morphology, ethnoclassification, and traditional knowledge. Samples were purchased from seventeen herbal shops in Iran. Each sample’s vernacular name was recorded. Samples were identified based on morphological characteristics and assigned to families, genera, and species when possible. Putative scientific names were extracted from the literature based on previously established correspondence with vernacular names. DNA was extracted from 68 samples that could not be identified to species level using morphology, and the nrITS and trnL markers were amplified and sequenced. The resulting sequences were queried against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database and identified using both approaches. \nResults\nObjective sequence matching yielded a 16.7 percent species-level identification rate for trnL, a 33.3 percent rate for nrITS, and a 38.2 percent rate when both markers were combined. The integrative approach resulted in a 75.0 percent species-level identification rate for trnL, a 79.2 percent rate for nrITS, and a 80.9 percent rate when the markers were combined, and thus a 3.5, 1.4 and 1.1 fold increase in species-level identification, respectively. \nSignificance\nDNA barcoding is an effective method to identify traded plant material that lacks morphological characteristics in processed form, but requires integrative strategies to include data from multiple markers, morphology, and traditional knowledge to optimize species-level identification success.</string>
    <string name="id418">Presenting Author: Yao, Hui\n\nContact: scauyaoh@sina.com\n\nAuthors: Hui Yao, Jingyuan Song, Jianping Han, Linchun Shi, Wei Sun, Shilin Chen\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nIn recent years, traditional identification methods (botanical source and morphological identification, microscopic identification, and physiochemical identification) have been unable to meet the demands of rapid development in China’s pharmaceutical industry. DNA barcoding technology emerged in 2003 and revolutionized the available identification methods. Our team proposed and verified that nuclear ITS2 is suitable to identify traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). A novel identification system for Chinese herbal medicines in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP), which employs DNA barcodes, was set up and has been adopted in the latest ChP (2015 edition). However, systematic research on identification of TCMs in ChP by using DNA barcoding remains inadequate. \nResults\nIn this study, we established a DNA barcoding database for medicinal species in ChP (http://www.tcmbarcode.cn/en/). One sample of original species and three samples of medicinal materials were available for each Chinese materia medica. Most of the samples were collected from China, whereas some of them were collected from other countries, such as Japan, Korea, Canada, and the United States. To date, six different modules have been implemented in the web server, namely, Identification, Protocol, Database, News, Documents, and Register. In the Identification module, nr ITS2 was the core DNA barcode for identifying medicinal plants, whereas the psbA-trnH region was a complementary barcode. COI was used to identify medicinal animals. \nSignificance\nThe database provides standard sequences for each medicinal species in ChP, thereby contributing great practical significance to clinical safety in utilization of TCMs. Furthermore, this system can help prevent illegal drug trade in circulation.</string>

Lekganyane, Olivier Maurin, Herman van der Bank, Michelle van der Bank\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nApproximately 80 percent of South Africans use traditional medicine (“muthi”) as an important component of primary health care, which is traded at informal markets. Specialized gatherers harvest these plants mostly from wild resources, which reach the market via middlemen. Importantly, 86 percent of plants harvested will result in the death of the plant. This results in noticeable levels of species depletion, whilst increasing the incentive to adulterate products. Morphological similarities make identifying samples on a taxonomic level challenging. Furthermore, plants are traded using local names, which do not always respond with scientific names. Here we measure the efficacy of DNA barcoding to identify bulbous and perennial herbs traded at one of the largest traditional medicinal market in South Africa. A list of species traded, including their conservation status, is compared against a known published checklist (based on morphological identification) to note any decline or incline in the number of species traded. \nResults\nIn total 61 plants were collected and sequenced for the core barcoding regions; sequencing success was higher for rbcLa (91 percent) than matK (72 percent). BLAST searches using rbcLa resulted in high numbers of ambiguous identifications, whilst searches using matK were less ambiguous, allowing the majority of samples to be identified to genus level (95 percent). When combining rbcLa & matK most of the samples could be identified to species level. \nSignificance\nIdentification success is generally high in our dataset, although closely related species remain problematic to identify. Our survey shows a slight increase in species traded at the market since 2003, and that the majority of species traded are not currently endangered. However, 13 percent of species traded are declining or near threatened in the wild. This poses a serious conservation issue, since if trade continues in an unsustainable way, these plants could swiftly become critically endangered in the near future.]]></string>
    <string name="id534">Presenting Author: Shaw, Pang-Chui\n\nContact: pcshaw@cuhk.edu.hk\n\nAuthors: Pang-Chui Shaw, Ka-Lok Wong, Yat-Tung Lo\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA barcoding is now a widely used approach for the identification of biological specimens to the level of species and discovery of cryptic species. Through improvement on extraction protocols and primer design, herbal species can now be identified in decoctions and commercial products. Nevertheless, our studies have shown that DNA markers have several limitations that influence the success rate and accuracy of sequencing. \nResults\nThe first shortcoming is the inadequate resolving power of DNA barcodes in some taxa. After analyzing seven DNA loci, including rbcL, matK, trnH-psbA, rpl36-rps8, ITS, trnL-F, and 5S rRNA, of the Gentiana taxa, only the latter two were able to discriminate closely related species G. triflora, G. scabra, and G. manushruica. In the study of Acontium, 19 taxa were clustered into ten groups based on trnH-psbA, while the two most commonly used medicinal species, A. carmchaeli and A. kusnezoffii, could not be differentiated definitely. The second shortcoming is the difficulty in amplifying DNA barcodes across a broad range of taxa by universal primers. Alignment analysis revealed that there were 3-4 different nucleotides between the universal primer for (matK 3F Kim f) and the sequences of 17 taxa in the genus Gentiana, and four out of ten samples of Gentiana could be not amplified. The third issue is the amplicon size of DNA for highly degraded or processed samples. Only short PCR products of about 100 bp were found in Panax ginseng decoction boiled for 2hr. In such cases, a mini-barcode may be employed to enhance the success rate. The fourth problem is amplification of the contaminant species in old herbal materials. ITS was employed in a Chinese ‘cooling’ beverage study, in which among 145 sequences, 85.5 percent were derived from intended species, while the rest were contaminated by fungal or other parasitic species. \nSignificance\nDNA barcoding is a powerful tool for authentication. For herbal materials, there are limitations in the applications due to possessing, storage, and the existence of closely related materials.</string>

Shiba, Olivier Maurin, Herman van der Bank, Michelle van der Bank\n\nAbstract:\n\nBackground\nAll Encephalartos species are listed in CITES Appendix I and in the national Threatened or Protected Species regulations, which prohibit trade in wild plants. Despite these regulations, illegal bark harvesting for medicinal trade has increased in South Africa and resulted in declines in cycad populations, and even complete loss of sub-populations (e.g. type locality of Encephalartos natalensis). Encephalartos species, locally known as ‘isiGqiki-somkovu’, are traded at traditional medicinal markets in the form of ‘bark’ strips and stem sections; thus, determining the actual species traded presents a major challenge due to lack of characteristic plant parts. Here we present a case study on the use of DNA barcoding to identify cycads sold at Faraday market in South Africa. In total, 37 samples were collected, and sequences for the two barcoding regions (rbcLa and matK) and two additional genes (trnH-psbA and ITS) were generated. We then utilized the large barcoding database for cycads available at the University of Johannesburg to assign query samples to known species. Three approaches were followed viz.: (1) tree-based method, (2) BLAST algorithm, and (3) character-based method (BRONX). \nResults\nMarket species identified and their IUCN status were: Encephalartos aemulans (Critically Endangered), E. lebomboensis (Endangered), E. natalensis (Near Threatened), and E. senticosus (Vulnerable). This is the first record of E. aemulans being traded at Faraday market. This species is critically endangered and known only from two populations in KwaZulu-Natal. Furthermore, results indicate that the majority of samples entering the Faraday market are harvested in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. \nSignificance\nOverall, we determined that DNA barcoding is an ideal genetic-based tool for the correct identification of fragmented cycad material that cannot be identified by traditional means. Furthermore, results from this study are crucial to make appropriate assessments and decisions on how to manage these markets and for cycad conservation in general.</string>
    <string name="id60">Presenting Author: Thomas, Gyimah\n\nContact: gyimthom@yahoo.com\n\nAuthors: Gyimah Thomas\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDue to high poverty levels coupled with a high patient-to-doctor ratio in Ghana, most people, especially the urban poor and rural dwellers, resort to herbal medicines for their primary healthcare. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for herbal medicine, leading to overharvesting of many important species. However, the safety and efficacy of herbal medicine depends on the ability to correctly identify the plants used in their preparation. This study sought to use DNA barcoding as an identification tool in the authentication of herbal medicines and sustainable management of medicinal plants species in southern Ghana. Silica-dried leaf samples from fifty seven different medicinal tree species covering 24 families were collected from three different conservation areas: Ankasa, Bia, and Kakum. Sequences from the barcode region of rbcL were generated for 119 samples, with a minimum sequence length of 431 base pairs (bp) and a maximum of 579 bp. \nResults\nA sequencing success rate of 94.6 percent was achieved. Twenty out of the fifty seven medicinal plants already sequenced were randomly selected and collected from farmlands within the Akuapem North district of the Eastern region of Ghana and sequenced at the same gene region. This was done to test the utility of the database in identifying medicinal plants. \nSignificance\nEach of the sequences in the later-collected farm dataset matched closely with their conspecific counterparts in our reference dataset, which suggests DNA barcoding can be used in the identification of medicinal plant species to ensure authenticity of herbal medicines in Ghana.</string>

Earlier studies have reported species adulteration in natural health products, medicinal plants from Southern Morocco, Chinese patent medicines, and North American herbal products. DNA barcoding studies on medicinal plant raw drugs are very much limited in India. This study reports a large-scale study on species adulteration in diverse medicinal plant raw drugs. \nResults \n We assembled a reference DNA barcode library consisting of 1,434 rbcL and matK barcodes from 521 medicinal plant species in our study. Subsequently, we used this library to test for species adulteration in 112 traded raw drugs in the form of dried roots, rhizomes, leaves, seeds, fruits, whole plants, and powders that do not posses intact morphological features for reliable identification. The rbcL DNA barcodes from 90 raw drugs (80 percent approx.) showed matching with expected species in the barcode library. The remaining 22 raw drugs (20 percent approx.) had adulterated plant material, which showed 1.5 to 10.2 percent genetic divergence with expected species. All the adulterant species belonged to different genera, and 14 of them belonged to different family, when compared with the species mentioned on the label. Species adulteration was more frequent with raw drugs in the form of dried roots, powders, and whole plants than others. Eight adulterant species shared some of the medicinal properties with expected species, and seven of them had a completely different medicinal property or toxic property. \nSignificance\n Morphological resemblance, co-occurrence, mislabeling, confusing vernacular names, and unauthorized or fraudulent substitutions may contribute to species adulteration. This pilot research will enable more comprehensive surveys of species adulteration in the trade of medicinal plant raw drugs. Our findings indicate that DNA barcoding of the traded raw drugs will be useful to all the stakeholders: traders, consumers, and regulatory agencies.</string>

As the fundamental step to confirm the quality of an herbal product is through species authentication, DNA barcoding offers a good alternative for detecting plant-based adulterants in traded herbal medicinal materials. In the present study, we aimed to establish a reference DNA barcoding database for 100 common medicinal plants in Malaysia for species identification and authentication. \nResults\nDNA barcodes were generated using four plastid markers, rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, and trnH-psbA. The performance of all plastid markers in recovering species groups was evaluated using similarity BLAST and phylogenetic trees. The rbcL, rpoC1, and rpoB, which are more conserved, were chosen as core coding region to serve as a baseline for comparison. The analyses showed that rbcL, rpoC1, and rpoB provided apparent resolution at the species level and were able to separate the majority of the species. To improve the identification to species, trnH-psbA appeared promising as a second-tier locus. This particular region was able to increase the resolution of species identification significantly. As a whole, our analysis indicates the potential of using a multigene, tiered approach for DNA barcoding of common medicinal plants in Malaysia. \nSignificance\nA methodology to identify and authenticate medicinal plant species is very much in demand in the herbal industry. In Malaysia, the National Pharmaceutical Control Bureau provides mostly chemical-based adulterant screening; therefore, DNA barcoding authentication would be a good addition to complement the existing methods.</string>

These factors may allow these species to inhabit areas outside of their native range and habitats. Cultivation and breeding may also influence the distribution and diversity of Physalis species in India. Physalis lagascae (Physalis lagascae Roem. & Schult. = (P. minima auct non L.) is locally called: ciyattini, erumaittakkali, koticceni, koticcenittakkali, kutavayacceti; this is a traditional medicinal plant used for treating chronic ailments such as stomach ulcers and several forms of cancer. Another closely related species, Physalis peruviana, is referred locally as cirutakkali, cirutakkali, itayakali, nattuttakkali, and is known to inhabit the same areas as P. lagascae. The two species are often confused due to their morphological similarity. However, P. peruviana has different medicinal properties from P. lagascae. Our research has shown that traditional healers have often misidentified these species and their respective medicinal properties. This is unfortunate because P. peruviana is invasive and widely abundant, while P. lagascae is a local species with reduced populations due to over exploitation for medicinal use and has even been extirpated in some areas of India. Hence, the authentication of this species is crucial for its conservation and for maintaining sufficient populations for the herbal industry. Our research utilized rbcL and ITS sequence data to clearly differentiate samples of Physalis peruviana and Physalis lagasae. DNA barcoding using the tiered approach may provide a useful authentication tool for differentiating these species, which could be used to authenticate medicinal materials and support conservation initiatives that support the preservation of small populations.]]></string>
    <string name="id426">Presenting Author: Hodgetts, Jennifer\n\nContact: jennifer.hodgetts@fera.co.uk\n\nAuthors: Jennifer Hodgetts, Jayne Hall, Joe Ostoja-Starzewski, Dom Collins, Chris Malumphy, Sharon Reid, Anastasia Korycinska, Thomas Prior, Rebecca Lawson, Neil Boonham\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nWith the continual increases in the importation of commodities into the UK from around the globe, the country is exposed to the risk of introduction of non-native, quarantine pests and pathogens. Therefore, the ability to rapidly detect pests and pathogens in a non-targeted approach has become increasingly important. To this end, in parallel with specific detection tools such as real-time PCR and LAMP applied in the laboratory and in the field, DNA barcoding has been implemented for identification of unknown pathogens. \nResults\nDNA barcoding has been applied to a wide range of organismal groups, in particular arthropod samples which are often intercepted dead or at inappropriate life stages for morphological identification without lengthy rearing processes. Numerous genera have been studied, leading to the first findings of quarantine species and numerous new host records. Additionally, the method is deployed for confirmation of morphological identifications, often to confirm that specimens are not quarantine species. In the majority of instances, the standard COI barcode is utilized; however, cases where this does not provide the required level of discrimination have been identified, for example within phytoseiid mites, where alternate barcode regions have been assessed and deployed to allow sequence-based discrimination. Various routes of entry have been demonstrated as potential risks, with significant findings of pests and pathogens within imported wood products, produce, and live plants for planting. Our approaches have led to the detection of serious pests, including the nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and its vector Monochamus alternatus, nematodes such as Meloidogyne species, and fruit flies such as Drosophila suzukii. \nSignificance\nDNA barcoding has been successfully used for the identification of first interceptions of quarantine organisms within imports to the UK. In addition, we have identified species of possible concern on ‘alert lists’, and new host records have been established. Barcoding is also being used in research and development, combined with morphological expertise, to elucidate previously cryptic species; for example, we have developed barcode markers for Leucinoides, a taxon for which effective barcode markers were not previously available.</string>

Arulandhu, Dr. Martijn Staats, Dr. Tamara Peelen, Dr. Esther Kok\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nUse of illegally traded endangered species (CITES) in products is a major issue throughout the world. In the EU, enforcement is mainly focused at the borders, where illegally imported products containing plants and/or animals will be seized by Customs and CITES Authorities. To allow the Customs laboratories to effectively perform the analysis of samples for the presence of endangered species, it is necessary to develop improved methods that can broadly identify any species present in samples such as in food supplements or traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). As suspected samples may often contain highly degraded DNA, it is a requirement that species can be identified on the basis of short DNA sequences. DNA metabarcoding promises to overcome the analysis problem of multiple ingredients, and it has been demonstrated to allow simultaneous identification of endangered species in highly processed forensic samples including TCMs. Here, we propose a DNA metabarcoding strategy for routine analysis of seized products that makes use of an extended set of plant and animal barcode markers that will improve resolution for identification (in case some markers fail) and/or improve quality assurance by verification of findings with more than one barcode marker. \nResult\nA panel of 12 full-length barcode and mini-barcode markers has been identified that can efficiently be amplified across a wide range of species using a single universal PCR protocol for all primer sets. Since using a proper DNA isolation method is critical for success, various DNA isolation kits and protocols have been evaluated on various TCM samples. Optimized NGS protocols and a user-friendly data analysis pipeline will be developed for robust and accurate identification of (CITES) species in various experimental and real-life samples. \nSignificance\nThis study will significantly present the prospects and limitations of DNA metabarcoding for endangered species identification in a routine setting.</string>

Monitoring biodiversity is especially important in the face of ongoing ecological and range shifts driven by anthropogenic activities, which are accentuated in ports where shipping promotes the introduction of non-native organisms. Metabarcoding of environmental samples offers the opportunity to rapidly characterize local biodiversity and potentially detect the early stages of species invasions. \nResults\nMock zooplankton communities were first used to assess the most effective bioinformatics approach to identify species from taxonomically diverse metabarcoding datasets. This approach was applied to characterize zooplankton biodiversity from natural communities sampled from 16 major ports spanning the three Canadian oceans and the Great Lakes basin. More than 7 million sequenced reads were taxonomically classified into over 400 families spanning 19 phyla. We detected the main taxonomic groups previously identified in these waters as well as several non-native species at low abundance, showcasing the breadth and sensitivity of metabarcoding. Zooplankton communities were distinct among ports from different coasts, and biodiversity profiles distinguished marine, estuarine, and freshwater samples. Temporal shifts in community composition were also captured, in which the most drastic turnover was observed in a sub-Arctic region with high beta diversity (0.9) between samples from May and August. \nSignificance\nWe present an extensive survey of zooplankton biodiversity across Canadian ports with heavy shipping traffic, setting a baseline to which future surveys can be compared for monitoring changes in community composition. Despite the need for more extensive reference databases, metabarcoding was shown to be effective in detecting both a broad range of taxa and species that probably naturally occur locally in low abundance. Our results provide a framework for the application of metabarcoding to monitor biodiversity and for the early detection of invasive species in environmental samples.</string>
    <string name="id608">Presenting author: Junko Shimura\n\nContact: junko.shimura@cbd.int\n\nAuthors: Junko Shimura and David Duthie\n\nAbstract:\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) is an integral policy framework for conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, and sharing the benefits arising from utilization of genetic resources with near-universal participation. Current human activities are causing biodiversity loss at unprecedented speed and scale. Invasive alien species are a threat to native species in all biogeographic regions, with estimates of global costs rising to some billions of dollars every year. According to the CBD Global Biodiversity Outlook 4th edition, many countries have initiated measures to address invasive alien species, although taking appropriate measures is challenging unless alien species are identified rapidly and accurately. \nThe Conference of the Parties to the Convention has requested the Secretariat to facilitate capacity building on identification of invasive and potentially invasive species. The Secretariat, in close partnership with the International Barcode of Life and funding from the Government of Japan, is providing training on rapid species identification for technical experts from 21 developing countries in 2015. \nThese trainees are expected to become in-country trainers spreading knowledge and capacity for rapid species identification in various sectors including trade, agriculture, and the environment. Although regulation on hazards is fairly well developed in chemicals, pests, and communicable diseases management, a challenge still exists in addressing growing numbers of alien species, for which invasion risk can vary in different ecosystems. In this context, national or regional-level capacity building is urgently needed for society to continue to develop and secure ecosystem services for human well-being. In addition, forensic DNA analysis for detection of environmental crimes, such as illegal trade of protected species (e.g. CITES-listed species), enables legal processes in biodiversity-rich countries. The high-throughput DNA sequencing also opens possibility of rapid assessment of wildlife in both aquatic and terrestrial environments, and mapping of phylogenetic diversity greatly helps setting conservation priority.</string>

During the last ten years, \'DNA barcoding\' using the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene as a molecular marker has achieved a better estimate of biodiversity. In this study, the diversity of mosquitoes was evaluated in four sampling sites in Quintana Roo State of Mexico. Morphological and genetic analyses were used for identification. \nResults\nBased on morphology, 14 species were identified, and three could be determined to genus, giving a total of 17 morphotypes belonging to the subfamily Culicinae. Four genera and eight species were new records for the study area. Kimura 2-parameter (K2P) intraspecific distances averaged 0.97%, while interspecific distances averaged 9.8%. Two closely related species, Aedes Ae. (Ochlerotatus) angustivittatus and Ae. (Ochlerotatus) trivittatus, showed just 0.89% sequence divergence between them. Furthermore, two individuals of Ae. (Ochlerotatus) angustivittatus had an interspecific distance of more than 2% (2.21). For Haemagogus equinus, the intraspecific K2P distance was more than 2% (2.63), corresponding to two clades with different BINs. In Uranotaenia sp., two individuals had distances > 2% (2.12%), but all individuals fell under the same BIN. Finally, in Limatus durhamii, one individual showed an intraspecific K2P distance of 3.43%. The total number of BINs assigned by BOLD systems was 19. The results suggest the need to add more individuals to analyses and to review in detail the clades with more than 2% of intraspecific K2P distances, which suggest the existence of cryptic genetic diversity or new species. \nSignificance\nIn total, 14 sequences were new to BOLD, and 15 were new to GenBank. The taxonomic and molecular database from this study will be used as a reference for future studies on the identification of mosquitoes in the Quintana Roo State.]]></string>

At Applied DNA Sciences (ADNAS) we have applied similar principles to protect and to manage the international supply chain for natural product based commodities. \nResults\nWe describe here ADNAS technology in the cotton supply chain, from the gin through processing into clothing. The study is based on a patented ADNAS technology, FiberTyping, which employs chloroplast genetic markers that can distinguish the highest quality of cotton Gossypium barbadense (also known as Extra Long Staple, ELS) from the lower quality cotton Gossypium hirsutum (also known as Upland). For this highly industrialized analysis, it is necessary to simplify the chloroplast marker set employed so that analysis can be done inexpensively upon thousands of samples per day, and to focus on very small, highly repeated DNA sites so that analysis can be performed on highly processed fabric where DNA has become partially degraded due to cell death at harvest, and subsequently, due to the chemical damage associated with processing, dying, and weaving. \nSignificance\nWe have demonstrated that cotton can be analyzed at the gin, then as dyed yarn, and subsequently as woven fabric, to obtain the ELS/Upland composition of the cotton at each step in the textile supply chain, employing a straightforward extension of PCR. Based on this pilot, we show that FiberTyping is now ready to be employed at an international scale to protect the (high value) ELS supply chain from accidental or criminal blending of (lower value) Upland cotton. More broadly, we view cotton FiberTyping as a model for the use of DNA barcoding principles as a way to protect the supply chain associated with other high-value commodities: wool, coffee, oils, and herbal products.</string>
    <string name="id356">Presenting Author: Ivanova, Natalia\n\nContact: nivanova@uoguelph.ca\n\nAuthors: Natalia Ivanova, Maria Kuzmina, Thomas Braukmann\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nDNA-based testing has been gaining acceptance for a wide range of food products and has potential for authentication of herbal supplements. In our study we tested fifteen herbal supplements corresponding to five medicinal plants, each from three different manufacturers: Echinacea purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum, and Trigonella foenum-graecum. To maximize DNA recovery from processed plant materials, oil-free tablets or gelatine capsules were chosen for testing. Listed ingredients consisted of dried aerial parts, seeds or roots; plant extracts or extracts combined with raw plant material (with or without fillers). Experimental design included three modifications of DNA extraction, each tested for three replicates and two lysate dilutions. To distinguish DNA degradation from PCR inhibition, we utilized PCR amplification of target DNA using primers targeting shorter regions in the presence of an internal positive control. \nResults\nOur results demonstrate reproducible detection of listed medicinal plant DNA in most supplements represented by dry herb form. Multiple DNA sources rendered Sanger sequencing results for rbcL and ITS2 regions non-interpretable, hence indicating the strong need for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Besides listed ingredients, we detected other plant DNA sources possibly associated with harvesting, or introduced during the manufacturing process, as airborne or equipment contaminants. The manufacturing process of plant extracts does not take into account DNA preservation; therefore, complementary analytical testing targeting bioactive components may be required to verify false-negative results. NGS analysis of the ITS2 region also revealed a diverse community of fungi, which may be associated with raw plant material and/or the fermentation process utilized in production of plant extracts. \nSignificance\nWe have developed a robust NGS workflow for authentication of DNA source in herbal supplements containing dry herb material, and some plant extracts. This workflow can be utilized by manufacturers for QA/QC of raw plant materials, production process, and final products.</string>

Newmaster, Ganeshaiah K.N., Uma Shaanker R., Ravikanth G.\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nThe global economy of international trade of herbal products and the alternative medicine market have been increasing at a rapid rate of approximately 15 per cent annually. Most of these herbal products are sourced from countries such as China and India. In India, about 8000 medicinal plant species are either cultivated or collected from the wild; of these, approximately 880 medicinal plants are in active trade. However, with increasing international trade in herbal medicinal products, there is also an increasing concern about the widespread adulteration and species admixtures in the raw herbal trade. The adverse consequences of such species admixtures on the health and safety of consumers are only recently beginning to be recognized and documented. \nResults\nWe provide a comprehensive review of the nature and magnitude of species admixtures in the raw herbal trade and identify the underlying drivers that might lead to such admixtures. We also discuss the possible biological and chemical equivalence of the species admixtures and substitutes and their consequences to consumer health and safety. \nSignificance\nWe propose a framework for the development of an herbal trade authentication service that can help regulate the herbal trade market.</string>

Khedkar\n\nAbstract:\nRecent enforcement of law (March 4, 2014) prohibiting the slaughter of “cow” includes bull, bullock, ox, or calf for the purpose of beef production in India. This law is enforced since Article 48 of the Indian constitution enjoins on the State to organise agriculture and animal husbandry on modern and scientific lines and in particular to take steps for preserving and improving the breeds and prohibiting the slaughter of cow and its progeny. In view of the consideration that the cow and its entire progeny must be saved to provide milk, as well as manure, it becomes imperative to impose a complete ban on cow slaughter. \nOne month after the law enforcement, we tried to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedures involved the present law on ban of beef production. We surveyed 585 meat-selling shops in Aurangabad city of Maharashtra State in India, of which 255 shops were found in beef retailing. Small meat samples were collected from 219 shops and analysed using DNA barcoding and by developing species-specific primers. Many shops claim the retailing of buffalo meat. Overall, DNA barcoding could be one of the effective and inexpensive tools in implementation of the law in reliable meat trading in India.</string>

Ford, Matthew Hegarty, Les Baillie\n\nAbstract:\nBackground\nHoney possesses therapeutic properties that are the result of a range of factors including high sugar content, low pH, hydrogen peroxide, and bee-derived peptides. Honey also contains antimicrobial phytochemicals, which represent a rich source of leads for the development of drugs for the treatment of microbial infections. Honey samples donated by UK beekeepers (217) and Manuka samples (3) were screened for the presence of novel antibacterial compounds by determining activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The majority (88%) of the honeys showed inhibitory activity; two of these samples were found to contain potentially novel antibacterial compounds, which were likely to be plant-derived. The pollen present in honey represents a record of the plants that contributed to the making of the honey and may be the source of specific antibacterial factors. For this reason, pollen was extracted and characterised from honey samples using microscopic analysis and rbcL DNA metabarcoding (454 and Illumina). \nResults\nDNA metabarcoding provided superior discrimination for some plant families and greater repeatability compared to microscopic analysis. Key species identified in the antibacterial samples included woodruff (Galium odoratum), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale). Extracts from active honeys and characterised plants demonstrated antibacterial activity against MRSA, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa. Activity-guided characterisation using a thin layer chromatography/mass spectrometry interface highlighted the presence of some known and some novel compounds. \nSignificance\nUnderstanding the floral composition of honey has a wide variety of applications. DNA metabarcoding pollen extracted from honey allows us to identify the plant species that may be contributing to the antimicrobial effect of honey. The demonstration of antibacterial activity may provide new lead compounds that could serve as selective agents against MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</string>
